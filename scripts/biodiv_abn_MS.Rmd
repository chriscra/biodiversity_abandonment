# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Though cropland expansion continues in many regions, substantial areas of cropland have been abandoned in recent decades due to demographic, socioeconomic, and technological changes.
Variation among species and habitats and limited information on the nature and duration of abandonment have resulted in controversy over how abandonment affects biodiversity.
Here, we use annual land-cover maps to estimate habitat changes for 1,322 bird and mammal species at 11 sites across four continents for 1987-2017.
We find that most bird (`r abstract_stats$percent_winner_bird_obs`%) and mammal species (`r abstract_stats$percent_winner_mam_obs`%) gain habitat due to cropland abandonment, yet even more would have benefited (`r abstract_stats$percent_winner_bird_pot`% and `r abstract_stats$percent_winner_mam_pot`%, respectively) if recultivation had not occurred.
Furthermore, many birds (`r abstract_stats$percent_loss_bird_full_obs`%) and mammals (`r abstract_stats$percent_loss_mam_full_obs`%) experienced net habitat loss after accounting for agricultural conversion that occurred before or alongside abandonment.
While cropland represents an important conservation opportunity, limiting recultivation and reducing additional habitat loss are essential if abandonment is to contribute to biodiversity conservation and recovery.

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Habitat loss through the clearing of land for agriculture is the most widespread threat to terrestrial biodiversity [@Tilman2017] and it continues to degrade many ecosystems [@Potapov2022].
Yet agricultural land-use change is not unidirectional: amidst continued cropland expansion, vast areas of cropland have been abandoned around the world in recent decades due to socioeconomic, demographic, and technological changes [@ReyBenayas2007; @Li2017; @Potapov2022; @Chazdon2020; @Zheng2023].
Global estimates of abandonment vary widely according to methodology, but recent satellite-based estimates place global cropland abandonment at 79 million ha (Mha) since 2003 [@Potapov2022] and 101 Mha since 1992 [@Zheng2023], with as much as 385-472 Mha of abandonment from 1700 to 2000 when considering historical reconstructions of both cropland and pastures [@Campbell2008].
Whereas expansion has been largely, but not exclusively, concentrated in the tropics, abandonment has primarily occurred in the Global North [@Potapov2022; @Li2017; @Chazdon2020], resulting in slower net expansion [@Potapov2022; @Isbell2019].
As agriculture intensifies and rural outmigration, urbanization, and globalization continue, abandonment is likely to accelerate [@Sanderson2018; @Taylor2021], and former croplands could offer low-cost opportunities to restore ecosystems [@Navarro2012], sequester carbon [@Griscom2017; @Yang2020], and recover biodiversity [@Chazdon2020; @Xie2019; @Baumann2020].

However, biodiversity is not guaranteed to benefit when cropland is abandoned.
Spatial and temporal variation in the distribution of abandonment substantially affects biodiversity outcomes because species have unique ranges and habitat requirements.
Furthermore, the recovery of natural ecosystems often requires multiple decades [@Acevedo-Charry2019; @Isbell2019; @Nerlekar2020].
If succession is interrupted by recultivation, which frequently occurs within a decade or two, such sites are unlikely to accumulate substantial amounts of carbon or biodiversity [@Yin2020; @Crawford2022; @Dara2018].
Together, these factors have fueled a controversy about the extent to which abandonment can benefit biodiversity [@Queiroz2014; @ReyBenayas2007].

This controversy is especially strong in Europe and East Asia [@Li2017; @Queiroz2014; @Daskalova2023], where conservation often focuses on "farmland biodiversity," including species that depend on open habitats and low-intensity farmland as a result of centuries of cultivation, disruption of natural disturbance regimes, and cultural preferences [@Batary2015; @Fischer2008; @Fischer2012a].
In those settings, abandonment is often viewed negatively because it reduces landscape heterogeneity and the amount of open habitats, notwithstanding its potential to benefit other types of species [@Queiroz2014; @Navarro2012; @Daskalova2023].
In contrast, abandonment is often viewed positively in Central and South America, where it provides an opportunity for forest habitats to recover [@Queiroz2014; @Chazdon2020].
Given species' unique responses to land-use change [@Sirami2008; @Finch2019; @Sugimoto2022, @VanderZanden2017; @Koshida2018], conservationists must assess the effects of abandonment across diverse landscapes

Though many studies have investigated abandonment's effect on local biodiversity [@Bowen2007; @Sirami2008; @Uchida2014; @Plieninger2014; @Regos2016; @Isbell2019], few have investigated how abandonment affects biodiversity at the landscape scale across multiple regions of the world (though see reviews by Rey Benayas et al. [@ReyBenayas2007] and Queiroz et al. [@Queiroz2014]).
Crucially, prior studies have generally lacked the spatial and temporal resolution required to track abandonment dynamics through time and evaluate trends for individual species [@Daskalova2023].
Given the highly dynamic nature of abandonment and the importance of regeneration time for ecosystem recovery, these details are critical to understanding abandonment's implications for biodiversity [@Daskalova2023].

Recent efforts to more accurately and precisely map abandonment from satellite imagery now provide annual maps of cropland abandonment with 30-m spatial resolution for many regions across the globe [@Yin2020] (mapping pasture abandonment from satellite imagery remains a technical challenge and is not captured in these data). 
Here, we combine high-resolution annual land-cover time series covering the years 1987-2017 for 11 sites on four continents [@Yin2020] (Fig. \@ref(fig:global-map-w-wisc)) with range maps and habitat preferences for 1,322 species of birds and mammals to calculate changes in habitat area (range maps refined to Area of Habitat [AOH], hereafter "habitat") [@Brooks2019] resulting from cropland abandonment that occurred between 1988 and 2017 and which satisfied a five-year abandonment definition.

We address three questions: 
(i) How did cropland abandonment affect habitat availability for bird and mammal species, and how did the number of species that gained ("winners") or lost ("losers") habitat differ across sites and for different species traits?
(ii) To what extent did recultivation limit habitat gains following abandonment?
(iii) Did habitat changes resulting directly from abandonment compensate for a) the initial habitat cleared for croplands that were later abandoned or b) cropland expansion that occurred elsewhere in the site?

In answering these questions, we provide the most detailed examination to date of how cropland abandonment affects biodiversity across multiple spatial and temporal scales.
Our analysis demonstrates that cropland abandonment holds the potential to increase habitat area for most bird and mammal species at sites that have recently experienced abandonment, yet these gains rarely compensate for habitat loss that takes place before or alongside abandonment.
Moreover, these benefits are reduced by frequent recultivation of once-abandoned croplands, limiting gains for many species.
Together, these results illuminate the limited but tangible conservation benefits of cropland abandonment and highlight the steps necessary to harness broad agricultural land-use transitions for the benefit of biodiversity.

## Changes in area of habitat resulting from cropland abandonment {.unnumbered}

Overall, we found that most bird (`r aoh_stats_main$n_gain_bird_percent`%) and mammal (`r aoh_stats_main$n_gain_mam_percent`%) species at our sites consistently gained area of habitat (AOH) from abandonment, experiencing statistically significant (p < 0.05) and positive trends in habitat everywhere they occurred (Table \@ref(tab:main-aoh-stats-table), Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn-prop)).
In contrast, only `r aoh_stats_main$n_loss_bird_percent`% of birds and `r aoh_stats_main$n_loss_mam_percent`% of mammals lost habitat consistently across sites due to abandonment (Table \@ref(tab:main-aoh-stats-table), Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn-prop)).
However, some species exhibited contrasting trends at different sites: `r aoh_stats_main$n_w_gain_bird_percent`% of birds and `r aoh_stats_main$n_w_gain_mam_percent`% of mammals gained habitat at some sites but showed no trend (p > 0.05) at others (i.e., “weak” gains), while `r aoh_stats_main$n_w_loss_bird_percent`% and `r aoh_stats_main$n_w_loss_mam_percent`% respectively lost habitat at some sites with no trend at others (i.e., “weak” losses, Table \@ref(tab:main-aoh-stats-table)).
Additionally, `r aoh_stats_main$n_opposite_bird_percent`% of birds and `r aoh_stats_main$n_opposite_mam_percent`% of mammals exhibited significant gains at some sites but significant losses at others (i.e., "mixed").

The ratio of winners to losers varied among sites, but was always greater than one (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn-prop), Table \@ref(tab:aoh-stats-by-site)), except for birds in Iraq (the site with the lowest species richness; Fig. \@ref(fig:richness-by-site)), where `r 100*(1-aoh_stats_main$wl_iraq)`% more species lost than gained habitat (Figs. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn-prop) and \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn)).
In general, a greater share of mammal species gained habitat than bird species did, both at individual sites (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-stacked)) and overall (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-overall-stacked-w-pot) [REPLACE]) [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_gain_m_v_b$parameter`, *N* = `r sum(aoh_gain_bird_v_mam_tmp$N)`) = `r round(p_test_gain_m_v_b$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_gain_m_v_b$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_gain_m_v_b$p.value, digits = 2)))`].
Of the 66 threatened species (see Methods) occurring at our sites (Fig. \@ref(fig:richness-by-site)), `r prettyNum(round(100*p_test_iucn_all$estimate[2], 1), nsmall = 1)`% gained habitat following abandonment (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-iucn-by-site-crop-abn)), nearly the same proportion as for non-threatened species [`r prettyNum(round(100*p_test_iucn_all$estimate[1], 1), nsmall = 1)`%; two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_iucn_all$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_by_iucn_tmp %>% filter(aoh_type == "crop_abn_iucn") %>% .$N %>% sum()`) = `r prettyNum(round(p_test_iucn_all$statistic, digits = 2), nsmall = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_iucn_all$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_iucn_all$p.value, digits = 2)))`].
Only nine small-ranged species (3 birds and 6 mammals with ranges smaller than their respective Class's global median) occurred at our sites (\@ref(fig:richness-by-site-small)), of which eight gained habitat (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-range)).

Though the vast majority of species’ area of habitat trends were positive, those with declining trends lost a larger amount of habitat on average (-`r effect_size_stats_tmp$mean_aoh_lost_percent_obs`% of site area) than those with increasing trends gained (+`r effect_size_stats_tmp$mean_aoh_gained_percent_obs`% of site area; Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-change-percent-by-trend)).
However, the opposite pattern played out for species' habitat changes relative to the beginning of the time series: `r effect_size_stats_tmp$share_doubled_obs`% of winners doubled their habitat (or more), while only `r effect_size_stats_tmp$share_halved_obs`% of losers halved their habitat (or worse; Fig. \@ref(fig:log-ratio-aoh-change-by-site)).

To explore which ecological factors are associated with species' responses to cropland abandonment, we fit three linear models using species traits to predict (1) area of habitat trend (gain or loss), (2) magnitude of habitat change (as a percent of site area), and (3) relative change in habitat (the ratio of final to initial AOH).
We found that species habitat preferences (i.e., which habitats can be occupied by a species and are therefore considered "suitable" habitats) had a significant effect on responses to abandonment.
The ability to occupy grassland, forest, or savanna habitats all increased the odds of a species gaining habitat, with grassland suitability (i.e., the ability to occupy abandoned croplands that return to grassland) having the most substantial effect, increasing the odds of being a winner by a factor of `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "binary", str_detect(term, "grassland")) %>% pull(estimate)`, compared to `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "binary", str_detect(term, "forest")) %>% pull(estimate)` and `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "binary", str_detect(term, "savanna")) %>% pull(estimate)` for forest and savanna suitability, respectively (Table \@ref(tab:traits-mod-table-main)).
Grassland and savanna suitability were also associated with larger overall increases in habitat: on average, species that can occupy grasslands and savannas gained an additional area of habitat equal to `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "grassland")) %>% pull(estimate)`% and `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "sav")) %>% pull(estimate)`% of site area, respectively (an increase of `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "grassland")) %>% pull(estimate)`% of site area represents an increase in absolute area of `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "grassland")) %>% pull(estimate)` percentage points, e.g., from 10% to `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "grassland")) %>% pull(estimate) + 10`%).
Species that occupy grassland and forest habitats saw larger relative increases in habitat over time (by a factor of `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "log_ratio", str_detect(term, "grassland")) %>% pull(estimate)` and `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "log_ratio", str_detect(term, "for")) %>% pull(estimate)`, respectively), but species associated with savannas and shrublands experienced smaller relative changes (reducing area of habitat by factors of `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "log_ratio", str_detect(term, "sav")) %>% pull(estimate)` and `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "log_ratio", str_detect(term, "shrub")) %>% pull(estimate)`, respectively; Table \@ref(tab:traits-mod-table-main)).
Wetland, rocky habitat, and urban area suitability were each associated with losing habitat, but arable land suitability was by far the strongest predictor that a species would lose habitat following abandonment, being associated with a `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "binary", str_detect(term, "arable")) %>% pull(estimate)` factor reduction in the odds of gaining habitat, an absolute habitat reduction of `r -1 * (filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "arable")) %>% pull(estimate))`% of site area, and a relative reduction in the habitat by a factor of `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "log_ratio", str_detect(term, "arable")) %>% pull(estimate)`.

Species using a greater number of habitats or with larger geographical ranges had larger increases in area of habitat, with species' habitat increasing by `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "n_suitable")) %>% pull(estimate)`% of site area for each additional suitable habitat type and `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "range")) %>% pull(estimate)`% of site area for each order of magnitude increase in range size.
Tropical species benefited more than temperate species: For each additional degree of latitude the center of a species' range is from the equator, area of habitat declined by `r -1*(filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "latitude")) %>% pull(estimate))`% of site area.
Range area and latitude were also associated with larger relative habitat gains.
Preferences for cave or desert habitats, vertebrate class, IUCN threat status, trophic level, and body mass did not have significant associations across any of our models (Table \@ref(tab:traits-mod-table-main)).

## Effects of recultivation on area of habitat {.unnumbered}

Many abandoned croplands were recultivated during our study period (38.05% on average across sites @Crawford2022), which affected species’ habitat trends substantially.
Had no recultivation occurred, the percentage of consistent winners would have been `r obs_v_pot_stats$n_gain_bird_pot_percent`% instead of `r aoh_stats_main$n_gain_bird_percent`% for birds and `r obs_v_pot_stats$n_gain_mam_pot_percent`% instead of `r aoh_stats_main$n_gain_mam_percent`% for mammals (Table \@ref(tab:main-aoh-stats-table), Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-obs-v-pot-by-site); both statistically significant increases, see SI Section \@ref(si-prop-test-results)).
However, a lack of recultivation would have also slightly increased the number of losers (from `r aoh_stats_main$n_loss_bird_percent`% to `r obs_v_pot_stats$n_loss_bird_pot_percent`% for birds and `r aoh_stats_main$n_loss_mam_percent`% to `r obs_v_pot_stats$n_loss_mam_pot_percent`% for mammals, Table \@ref(tab:main-aoh-stats-table)).

Species in Mato Grosso were most dramatically affected by recultivation, where an additional `r filter(n_aoh_trend_changes_by_site_df, site == "mato_grosso")$gain` species would have gained habitat while only an additional `r filter(n_aoh_trend_changes_by_site_df, site == "mato_grosso")$loss` would have lost habitat had recultivation not occurred.
Aside from Chongqing (`r filter(n_aoh_trend_changes_by_site_df, site == "chongqing")$gain` additional winners, `r filter(n_aoh_trend_changes_by_site_df, site == "chongqing")$loss` additional losers) and Nebraska/Wyoming (`r filter(n_aoh_trend_changes_by_site_df, site == "nebraska")$gain` additional winners), all other sites experienced fewer than 3 additional winners or losers in our scenario without recultivation (Table \@ref(tab:aoh-changes-obs-v-pot), Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-obs-v-pot-by-site)).
Preventing recultivation also would have amplified the magnitude of habitat changes, with winners gaining and losers losing relatively more habitat (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-change-percent-by-trend-obs-v-pot)).
This effect was more intense for losers, which lost `r obs_v_pot_stats$mean_p_loss_same`% more habitat on average, whereas winners only gained `r obs_v_pot_stats$mean_p_gain_same`% more habitat on average.

## Abandonment in the context of broader land-cover changes {.unnumbered}

Thus far, we have examined whether abandonment results in more or less habitat relative to actively cultivated cropland (Calculation 1, Table \@ref(tab:main-aoh-stats-table), Fig \@ref(fig:aoh-sample-trajectories)).
However, the original land cover at the beginning of our study period is another important consideration when evaluating the magnitude of benefits from abandonment.
Accordingly, we examine whether the benefits of abandonment could compensate for (i) the initial habitat cleared for the cultivation of croplands that were later abandoned (Calculation 2) or (ii) habitat loss that occurred elsewhere in our study areas due to cropland expansion (Calculation 3).
In other words, did abandonment return habitat levels on abandoned croplands to their pre-cultivation baseline (i.e., relative to the start of the time series, Calculation 2), or compensate for cropland expansion taking place across the entire site (Calculation 3)?
When considering the net habitat change after incorporating these processes, the ratio of winners to losers became much less favorable (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-overall)): about equal numbers of mammal species overall experienced habitat gains as experienced losses, and more bird species overall experienced habitat losses than those with gains (Table \@ref(tab:main-aoh-stats-table), Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-overall-w-pot)).
Both declines in the share of winning species were statistically significant (see SI Section \@ref(si-prop-test-results)).

While the number of losing species increased at every site when factoring in the pre-cultivation baseline and cropland expansion alongside abandonment (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-stacked)), these increases were most pronounced in Mato Grosso, Brazil, where less abandonment and much more cropland expansion occurred than at the other sites (Figs. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-max-abn) and \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-full)).
Our sites in Bosnia & Herzegovina; Chongqing, China; and Goiás, Brazil also had unfavorable ratios of winners to losers after accounting for cropland expansion, but the other sites had narrowly favorable ratios (particularly for mammal species; Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-full)).
Similarly, a greater share of threatened species lost habitat when factoring in cropland expansion prior to or alongside abandonment, but not statistically more so than non-threatened species (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-iucn-lumped)).
Limiting recultivation would have reduced the number of losing species in both of these broader habitat calculations (Calculations 2 and 3) and would have resulted in a favorable ratio of winners to losers even after factoring in habitat clearing for agriculture prior to abandonment (Calculations 2 and 3; Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-overall-w-pot)).
However, limiting recultivation would have had a positive but much smaller effect when considering habitat changes across the entire spatial extent (Calculation 3).

We also explored changes in landscape configuration by calculating common fragmentation statistics for cropland, grassland, and forest land cover classes annually at each site.
While area in forest and grassland land cover increased over time at every site but Mato Grasso, Brazil [@Crawford2022] these land cover classes became less aggregated over time: linear trends in our aggregation metric (see Methods) were predominantly negative over time (though statistically significant at only half of our sites; Figs. @\ref(fig:frag-heatmap)-@\ref:(fig:frag-clumpy)).
In contrast, cropland showed positive trends in our aggregation metric over time.
Mean patch area largely decreased for cropland and forest over time across most sites, but increased for grassland (Figs. @\ref(fig:frag-heatmap) and @\ref(fig:frag-mean-area)).
Trends in perimeter-area ratios (a measure of patch shape complexity) for cropland and grassland were negative for most sites; trends for forest were mixed across sites Figs. @\ref(fig:frag-heatmap) and @\ref(fig:frag-perimeter-area-ratio)).
When comparing observed landscape configuration metrics in 2017 with a hypothetical landscape in which all abandoned lands remained cropland, we observed similar trends, with aggregation and mean patch area declining and perimeter-area ratio increasing as a result of abandonment.

# Discussion {.unnumbered}

[START HERE]

Increasing rates of global cropland abandonment are reshaping agricultural landscapes around the world.
Our study, the first multi-continental assessment of the biodiversity impacts of cropland abandonment, shows that abandonment *per se* increases habitat for most bird and mammal species (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn-prop)).
These gains largely reflect species' habitat preferences, such that species that can occupy forests and grasslands were more likely to gain habitat, and species that occupy arable land were most likely to lose habitat. 
This reflects how abandonment affects the availability of specific habitat types, and in turn which species are affected.
Species with larger ranges, ranges closer to the equator, or the ability to use a greater number of habitats were more likely to gain habitat due to abandonment.
Overall, a greater share of bird species experienced declines in habitat following abandonment than mammals (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn-prop), Table \@ref(tab:main-aoh-stats-table)), though most birds and mammals still gained habitat overall.
The overall proportion of winners did not differ significantly for threatened versus non-threatened species (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-iucn-by-site-crop-abn)) nor for large- versus small-ranged species (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-range)).
From a conservation perspective, it is encouraging that most threatened and small-ranged species, which are often considered to be of greatest conservation concern, experienced gains in habitat.

However, habitat gains from abandonment were not uniform across species and sites, and abandonment rarely compensated for habitat lost to cropland expansion, regardless of whether these newly cultivated croplands were subsequently abandoned or not.
Most concerningly, habitat gains from abandonment were dampened by frequent recultivation: the ephemerality of abandonment reduced both the overall share of species with increasing trends (Figs. \@ref(fig:aoh-overall) and \@ref(fig:aoh-obs-v-pot-by-site), Table \@ref(tab:aoh-changes-obs-v-pot)) and the magnitude of habitat gains for species during our study period (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-change-percent-by-trend-obs-v-pot)).
This suggests that, despite the clear potential for abandonment to generate habitat for bird and mammal species, expectations for abandonment to reverse trends for declining species must be tempered because most landscapes are still experiencing habitat loss coupled with recultivation.

Our sites represented nine different biomes where differences in species communities, species richness, and the distributions of habitats produced unique responses to abandonment (Fig. \@ref(fig:site-biomes)).
In our three tropical sites (Figs. \@ref(fig:global-map-w-wisc)a and \@ref(fig:site-biomes)), we found the highest number of winning species, led by Mato Grosso and Goiás, Brazil (Table \@ref(tab:aoh-stats-by-site); Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn)).
Tropical sites also showed the largest overall benefits from abandonment, with the highest absolute numbers of species gaining habitat due to high species richness in the tropics (Fig. \@ref(fig:richness-by-site)) and relatively higher sensitivity of tropical species to habitat modification (Figs. \@ref(fig:p-arable-suitability)-\@ref(fig:latitude-v-arable-suitability)).
However, we note that Mato Grosso experienced the least cropland abandonment of any site and thus remained dominated by habitat loss, which led to relatively small gains in habitat (one or two orders of magnitude smaller for individual species than in other sites, whether area is measured in absolute terms or as a percent of site extent; Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-sp-obs-crop-abn)) and the greatest share of species with losing trends when accounting for land-cover changes throughout the site (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-stacked)).
Though less speciose, sites in temperate grassland biomes (Volgograd, Russia; Orenburg, Russia/Uralsk, Kazakhstan; Nebraska/Wyoming, USA) had among the highest shares of winners overall ($\geq 80$%; Table \@ref(tab:aoh-stats-by-site), Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn-prop)).
Interestingly, Iraq showed the most unfavorable response to abandonment, with the highest proportion of species declining following abandonment of any site (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn-prop), Table \@ref(tab:aoh-stats-by-site)).
This may be due to the relative refuge provided by croplands amidst a harsh desert environment or Iraq's long history of human cultivation [@Balter2007; @Batary2015].

Our finding of overall positive outcomes of abandonment contrast with much of the existing literature on biodiversity and abandonment.
A review of existing studies [@Queiroz2014] showed that most site-specific studies reported that abandonment had negative effects on biodiversity overall. 
However, these outcomes varied substantially by taxonomic focus, biodiversity metrics, agricultural system, and whether biodiversity changes were framed in terms of the conservation value of pre-abandonment landscapes (i.e., farmland biodiversity) or post-abandonment ecosystems (i.e., regenerating through secondary succession).
Research perspectives on abandonment also varied by region (with predominantly negative views of abandonment in Europe and Asia), potentially the result of differences in conservation focus (e.g., which species are considered, and at what scale), or geographic differences in biodiversity responses [@Queiroz2014].

Our multi-continental results echo the heterogeneous species responses shown in prior studies [@Sirami2008;@Regos2016], but provide a more positive assessment of abandonment overall.
We found more species benefiting from abandonment than suffering from it in 10 of the 11 sites we studied across four continents.
Though lacking sites in Western or Central Europe, where previous studies have shown abandonment-related biodiversity declines, our results indicate that negative responses to abandonment (e.g., Iraq) may be regionally restricted.
Notably, even species inhabiting open habitats like grasslands and savannas benefited from abandonment at our sites, contrary to concerns that they might typically be "losers" in land abandonment scenarios.
However, the benefits of abandonment are typically overshadowed by the recultivation of abandoned sites and cropland expansion, which our results show can produce overall habitat declines despite gains from abandonment.
Though habitat regeneration following abandonment would benefit most birds and mammals at almost all of our sites, species that stand to lose habitat from this process should be monitored and, when necessary, incorporated into conservation planning efforts to ameliorate habitat losses, with particular attention given to the maintenance of open habitats that support threatened or rare species.

Our study has some limitations.
First, we analyzed remotely-sensed land cover data interpolated to specific habitat types delineated by IUCN [@IUCN2021] and BirdLife International [@BirdLife2021], which do not provide a reliable proxy for habitat quality, particularly when quality is related to post-abandonment regeneration time (e.g., not distinguishing intact old-growth forests from young secondary forests).
Abandoned agricultural land can become suitable habitat for species associated with natural ecosystems, but regeneration can take many decades to achieve a species richness or community composition comparable to an intact ecosystem [@Acevedo-Charry2019; @Isbell2019; @Nerlekar2020].
We manually excluded species that require habitats older than 30 years (the length of our study period).
However, if post-abandonment successional habitats are protected from recultivation, species that require old-growth habitats are also likely to benefit from abandonment, while species characteristic of earlier successional stages are likely to decline or disappear.

Second, post-abandonment habitats will not be uniformly suitable for species, even as a function of age.
Several factors affect the speed and success of natural regeneration [@Chazdon2016], including legacies of cultivation (e.g., invasive plants, residual pesticides, etc.), proximity of source populations of plants and animals, and changes to natural disturbance regimes (e.g., fire).
These environmental characteristics as well as differences in dispersal ability among bird and mammal species will affect which species actually occupy and persist at a given abandoned site.
Regeneration of grasslands and other open habitats is especially hard to forecast, as such habitats are frequently maintained through grazing or fire.
When these disturbances are absent, as is common following cropland abandonment, shrub and tree regrowth may dominate over grasses [@ReyBenayas2007; @Nerlekar2020; @VanderZanden2017].

Third, while birds and mammals are commonly used as general indicators for biodiversity [@Westgate2017], other taxonomic groups may respond to abandonment differently, particularly following the abandonment of certain types of croplands.
For example, the abandonment of rice paddy agriculture in Japan has been associated with large declines in the abundance and species richness of many fish, amphibian, and plant species, alongside moderate increases of bird and mammal species [@Koshida2018].
We excluded amphibians and reptiles from our study due to greater uncertainty about their distributions and habitat requirements, but these taxa deserve future study.
Finally, although our study sites covered four continents, they were restricted in area, and we therefore could not assess how cropland abandonment affected habitat availability across the full range of any species, which would be required to estimate changes in global extinction risk and population trends.

By connecting high-resolution time-series data on cropland abandonment with species-specific distribution and habitat data for the first time, we find that cropland abandonment produced substantial gains in habitat for a majority of bird and mammal species over a 30-year period in 11 sites spread over four continents.
After accounting for the unique responses of individual species, we show that abandonment represents an opportunity to increase habitat availability for most bird and mammal species, including species of conservation concern.
Yet despite these encouraging results, our analysis of abandonment in the context of broader land-cover changes and cropland expansion reinforces an inconvenient truth in conservation: habitat loss due to agriculture remains a fundamental threat to species around the world.
Even in regions with substantial amounts of cropland abandonment, potential gains in habitat were limited by recultivation and outweighed by habitat losses from cropland expansion.
In order to unlock the conservation potential of abandoned croplands, policymakers will need to create incentives and community initiatives that will both prevent the recultivation of abandoned croplands and sustain and enhance habitat gains, while stopping further losses of natural and semi-natural ecosystems.
Doing so will be critical to slowing and ultimately reversing biodiversity loss.

# Methods {.unnumbered}

## Abandonment maps and definitions {.unnumbered}

Our analysis was based on 30-m annual land cover time series [@Yin2020] produced for 11 sites from 1987-2017 (Figs. \@ref(fig:lc-1987)-\@ref(fig:lc-2017)).
These sites, ranging from `r round(min(area_summary_df$total_site_area_ha_2017/10^6), digits = 2)` million to `r round(max(area_summary_df$total_site_area_ha_2017/10^6), digits = 2)` million ha (Mha) in area, were selected to represent areas with documented histories of cropland abandonment and cover a range of biomes across four continents, including drylands, temperate regions, and the sub-tropic and wet tropics (Fig. \@ref(fig:global-map-w-wisc)a).
We excluded three of the 14 sites mapped by Yin et al. [@Yin2020] due to low classification accuracy, following Crawford et al. [@Crawford2022].
The time series mapped four land-cover classes at high accuracy (average overall accuracy of $85\pm4$% [@Yin2020]): (i) cropland, (ii) herbaceous vegetation (e.g., grassland), (iii) woody vegetation (e.g., forest), and (iv) non-vegetation (e.g., water, barren, or urban land).
Previous work [@Crawford2022] mapped abandoned croplands by identifying periods of non-cropland (i.e., herbaceous or woody vegetation) that followed periods of cultivation and remained non-cropland for five or more consecutive years, following a commonly used five-year abandonment definition designed to exclude short-term fallow cycles [@FAO2016].
We used these abandonment maps to identify all pixels that were abandoned at least once during the time series (which we refer to as "abandoned pixels;" Figs. \@ref(fig:abn-lc-1987)-\@ref(fig:abn-lc-2017)).

## Calculating area of habitat from species range maps and habitat preferences {.unnumbered}

We calculated each species' area of habitat (AOH [@Brooks2019], sometimes referred to as "suitable habitat" or simply "habitat"), defined as the total area of a species' range that falls within suitable habitat types and elevations.
We sourced range maps for all bird and mammal species from Birdlife International [@BirdLife2021] and the IUCN [@IUCN2021], respectively, and extracted habitat and elevation preferences from individual IUCN assessments.
We excluded marine species and species classified as "Extinct" (EX) or "Extinct in the Wild" (EW), and only considered areas where species were considered “extant” and either "native" or "reintroduced," leaving 1,495 bird and 528 mammal species (2,023 total) with ranges overlapping at least one of our 11 sites.
For species with range maps delineated by season, we only consider areas where species are “resident,” “breeding,” or “non-breeding” (we exclude “passage” areas for migratory species).
For these species, we only considered those habitats marked as "suitable" in the relevant season associated with that portion of the range.
After filtering these species by elevation and seasonally-specific habitat preferences, the number of bird and mammal species with habitat within at least one site fell to 1,688 (1,175 birds and 513 mammals), with 1,533 being directly affected by abandonment (1,035 birds and 498 mammals).

Because species' habitat preferences listed in IUCN assessments do not account for the successional age of the habitat, we conservatively excluded from our analysis all species that require mature habitats in at least one season.
Forest-dwelling bird and mammal species were classified as mature forest obligates if they required habitats older than 30 years (i.e., the maximum age of abandoned croplands during our time series), according to habitat descriptions listed in IUCN assessments and individual species accounts in The Handbook of the Birds of the World [@BOW2022] and The Handbook of the Mammals of the World [@HMW2019].
This resulted in the exclusion of an additional 180 species of birds and 31 species of mammals, leaving 855 birds and 467 mammals (1,322 species total) in our analyses.

We defined species as "threatened" when assessed by the IUCN as "Vulnerable," "Endangered," or "Critically Endangered," and "not threatened" when assessed as "Near Threatened" or "Least Concern."
Species assessed as "Data Deficient" are excluded from any analysis of threat status.
We classified a species as "small-ranged" if their total global range area (extent of occurrence) fell below the global median (following Jenkins et al. [@Jenkins2013]).
The number of species at each site is shown according to threat status, habitat age requirements, and range size in Figs. \@ref(fig:richness-by-site) and \@ref(fig:richness-by-site-small).

## Translating from land cover to IUCN habitat types {.unnumbered}

Because AOH is calculated from habitat, not land cover, we translated the Yin et al. @Yin2020 land cover maps to match the IUCN's listed habitat types using a 100-m global map of IUCN habitat types for 2015 [@Jung2020a], resampled to 30-m resolution to match our land cover maps.
First, we developed a simple crosswalk between the generalized land cover types (e.g., forest) mapped by Yin et al. [@Yin2020] and the specific IUCN Level 2 habitat types (e.g., temperate forest), based on how each habitat type would likely be classified from satellite imagery (see Table \@ref(tab:iucn-crosswalk-table)).
Because this crosswalk delineates "one to many" relationships (i.e., one land cover class could be multiple IUCN habitat types), we next assigned individual pixels of land cover to the most common corresponding IUCN habitat type within the surrounding pixels in the Jung et al. [@Jung2020a] habitat map (SI Section \@ref(si-habitat-assignment)).

## Calculating area of habitat across multiple temporal and spatial scales {.unnumbered}

To isolate the direct effect of cropland abandonment on habitat availability (i.e., the change from cropland to abandoned cropland), we first calculated the area of habitat provided by pixels that were abandoned at some point during the time series ("Calculation 1;" Figs. \@ref(fig:abn-lc-1987)-\@ref(fig:abn-lc-2017)). 
For this calculation, we excluded any habitat provided by these pixels before each pixel's first year of cultivation during the time series.
Accordingly, we considered only habitat provided by croplands when they were actively cultivated, abandoned, or, where appropriate, recultivated (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-sample-trajectories)).

In order to compare the effect of abandonment on habitat availability with that of overall habitat loss and land-cover change at each site, we calculated habitat area (AOH) in two additional ways (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-sample-trajectories)).
Calculation 2 considered changes in habitat that took place exclusively in pixels that experienced abandonment at some point during the time series (following Calculation 1), but tracked changes across our entire time series, from 1987 through 2017.
This allowed us to consider the habitat contributions of abandonment relative to the 1987 baseline, accounting for any land cover that was cleared for agriculture prior to abandonment.

Finally, we calculated AOH for each species for the entire 1987-2017 time series and the entirety of our sites ("Calculation 3;" Figs. \@ref(fig:lc-1987)-\@ref(fig:lc-2017)).
This calculation placed abandonment into the context of broader land-cover change dynamics at each site and allowed us to consider the extent to which abandonment compensated for cropland expansion taking place alongside of abandonment.

Previously, Crawford et al. [@Crawford2022] showed that while substantial abandonment occurred at our eleven study sites (8.76 Mha of croplands were abandoned one or more times from 1987-2017), this abandonment was relatively short-lived and subject to high rates of recultivation (only 6.06 Mha of croplands remained abandoned as of 2017, with a mean age of 14.22 years).
In order to calculate the impact of recultivation on abandonment's effect on AOH, we also applied a scenario of "recultivation prevention" in which no recultivation took place after abandonment (following Crawford et al. [@Crawford2022]) to each of our three calculations of AOH.
In these scenarios, abandoned croplands were left abandoned from the year of initial abandonment through the end of the time series.

## Summarizing habitat area trends {.unnumbered}

We extracted trends in habitat area (AOH) over time for each bird and mammal species at each site by conducting linear regressions that predicted AOH as a function of year (converting raw AOH observations, shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-sp-obs-crop-abn), into trend lines, shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-trend-lines-crop-abn)).
In order to account for temporal autocorrelation present in individual species' trends in AOH (Fig. \@ref(fig:dw-stat)), we calculated the standard errors around the coefficient estimates with the Newey-West estimator [@Newey1987], a method designed to account for temporal autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity, using the fixest R package [@R-fixest].

AOH trends for a given species were classified as either gains or losses of habitat over time when slope coefficients were positive or negative, respectively, and statistically significant ($p<0.05$, i.e., the 95% confidence interval of the slope coefficient did not overlap with zero). 
We refer to these species as "winners" and "losers," respectively.
Species with AOH slopes that were not statistically significant ($p\geq0.05$) at a given site were classified as having "no trend."

When species occurred at multiple sites, there were sometimes contrasting trends.
Species with a significant trend at one or more sites, but no significant trend at other sites, were considered to have a "weak" trend overall ("weak gains" or "weak losses," depending on the direction of the relevant significant trend).
Species with significant gains at one or more sites and significant losses at others were considered to have "conflicting" trends, where the impact of abandonment is context dependent.

When reporting magnitudes of AOH changes, we provide two primary measures for each species at each site: 1) the magnitude of AOH change measured as a percent of site area ($100*(AOH_{end} - AOH_{start})/sitearea$, Figs. \@ref(fig:aoh-change-percent-by-trend) and \@ref(fig:aoh-change-percent-by-site)) and 2) the relative AOH change measured as the ratio of final to initial AOH, natural log-transformed ($ln(AOH_{end} / AOH_{start})$, Fig \@ref(fig:log-ratio-aoh-change-by-site)).
Both measures were calculated using the mean AOH value for the first five and last five years of the time series, in order to minimize the influence of annual variation.
We also report distributions of the absolute change in AOH ($AOH_{end} - AOH_{start}$; Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-change-by-site)), the untransformed ratio change in AOH (Fig. \@ref(fig:ratio-aoh-change-by-site)), and the slope coefficients estimated from linear regressions (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-slope-percent-by-site)).

## Species traits and the effect of abandonment on AOH {.unnumbered}

We fitted three linear models using species traits to predict (1) the AOH trend (binary, gain or loss), (2) the magnitude of AOH change (% of site area), and (3) the relative AOH change (natural log transformed).
We extracted trophic level and body mass variables from a database of species traits for mammals and birds [@Etard2020] and combined them with variables derived from individual IUCN assessments [@BirdLife2021; @IUCN2021], including habitat preferences (suitability of various IUCN Level 1 habitats), habitat breadth (counting the number of suitable IUCN Level 2 habitats, following Etard et al. @Etard2020), vertebrate class, threat status, global range size, and range latitude (i.e., "tropicality," measured as the absolute latitude of the centroid of a species range).
We extracted arable and urban land suitabilities from the artificial terrestrial habitat category and did not include the suitability of marine habitats as predictors.
To account for differences in the magnitude of abandonment at each site, we also included the percentage of each site that was abandoned during the time series, derived from Crawford et al. @Crawford2022.
The binary trend response variable was fit with a logistic regression, using R’s core glm() function with the “binomial” family, and the AOH magnitude response variables with a standard linear regression.
Model diagnostics were conducted through visual assessment of residual vs. fitted value plots (Fig. \@ref(fig:traits-model-resid-v-fitted)) and Q-Q plots (Fig. \@ref(fig:traits-model-qq)).
Expanded variable definitions and sources are contained in Table \@ref(tab:trait-variables-table).

## Assigning land cover to IUCN habitat types {#si-habitat-assignment}

In order to facilitate our annual area of habitat (AOH) calculations, we developed a method for assigning pixels in the Yin et al. [@Yin2020] land-cover classes to the more specific Level 2 habitat types the IUCN uses to describe species' habitat preferences.
This process was built on a 100-m resolution map of IUCN Level 2 habitat types for the year 2015 produced by Jung et al. [@Jung2020a] using a dynamic crosswalk between the 100-m Copernicus Global Land Service land-cover maps and the IUCN Level 2 habitat types.
We in turn developed a simple crosswalk between the four Yin et al. land-cover types and the IUCN Level 2 habitat types in the Jung et al. [@Jung2020a] map, which is shown in Table \@ref(tab:iucn-crosswalk-table).

Because there was not perfect spatial overlap between the Yin et al. [@Yin2020] land-cover maps and the crosswalked habitat types in the 2015 IUCN habitat map [@Jung2020a] (e.g., a pixel classified as grassland in one year of the Yin et al. [@Yin2020] map may not be classified as a grassland habitat type, such as temperate grassland, on the Jung et al. [@Jung2020a] map), we developed a method for assigning land cover pixels to the nearest habitat type on the Jung et al. [@Jung2020a] map that matched our land cover crosswalk.
We first separated the Jung et al. [@Jung2020a] map into four maps extracting out pixels based on which habitat types corresponded to our four Yin et al. [@Yin2020] land-cover classes.
We then used a focal filter to assign habitat types to the newly empty pixels (i.e., those that were previously habitat types in other land cover categories) based on the most common (i.e., modal) habitat type within the surrounding nine-pixel neighborhood (using the function `terra::focal(fun = "modal")`).
This resulted in four wall-to-wall maps of potential IUCN Level 2 habitat types for each pixel corresponding to each of the four Yin et al. [@Yin2020] land cover types.
These maps represented the IUCN Level 2 habitat that a given pixel of Yin et al. [@Yin2020] land cover would correspond to when the broad categories did not match up.
We then masked each of these maps of potential habitat types with the corresponding categories of land cover pixels in each year at each site, producing annual maps of the most likely IUCN habitat type for each pixel within each specific land cover category.
These maps were then combined to produce a consistent map of IUCN habitat types at each site in each year, which served as inputs for our area of habitat (AOH) calculations.
See maps below.

### Allocating savanna and shrubland habitats to land cover classes {#si-savanna-shrubland-jac}

Allocating the more specific IUCN Level 2 habitat types to the Yin et al. [@Yin2020] land-cover classes was straightforward for forests, grasslands, non-vegetation habitat types, and arable land, but less so for savanna and shrubland habitats, which are intermediate between entirely open grasslands and closed forests.
We considered shrubland and savanna habitat types to be a subset of our woody vegetation (i.e., forest) and herbaceous vegetation (i.e., grassland) land cover classes, respectively.
Because these habitats occupy an intermediate zone between land cover classes, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess similarity between land cover and reclassified habitat maps under the full range of possible crosswalks (Fig. \@ref(fig:jung-crosswalk-jac)).
We found similar levels of spatial overlap across these possible crosswalks, so we categorized these habitats based on how they would be classified directly from satellite imagery.

According to Jung et al. [@Jung2020a], sites with significant area classified as shrubland include: Belarus (14%); Bosnia & Herzegovina (7%); Wisconsin (9%); Iraq, Nebraska, and Shaanxi (1-2%); and Chongqing, Volgograd, and Orenburg (~0.5%).
Sites with significant area in savanna include: Goias (69%), Chongqing (19%), and Mato Grosso (10%).

Our default approach was to classify savanna and shrubland habitats as grassland and forest land cover respectively, but we explored the consequences of alternative classifications by testing spatial similarity between the resulting reclassified maps. 
We calculated Jaccard similarity between the Yin et al. [@Yin2020] land cover maps (for the year 2015) and the Jung et al. [@Jung2020a] habitat maps (for the year 2015) when reclassifying savanna and shrubland habitats as either forest or grassland.
The Jaccard similarity index is a measure of spatial similarity (i.e., overlap) between two sets, defined as the proportion of shared elements, or the intersection divided by the union (Equation \@ref(eq:jaccard-equation)) [@Legendre2012]:

\begin{equation}
J(a,b) = \frac{a\cap b}{a\cup b} (\#eq:jaccard-equation)
\end{equation}

The Jaccard similarity between reclassified maps across the full range of potential crosswalks are shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:jung-crosswalk-jac).
Based on these results, we classified savanna as grassland. 
For shrubland, there was variation in similarity between land cover maps under these different reclassification rules, but no clear trend.
As a result, we conservatively consider shrubland habitats to be a subset of forest land cover, given that shrublands are most spectrally similar to forests from a remote sensing perspective.

<!-- We found that: -->

<!-- 1. At the three sites with significant amounts of shrublands (Belarus, Bosnia & Herzegovina, and Wisconsin) - which are all in forested biomes - the similarity between grassland maps increases when shrublands are considered grasslands (as do forest maps). The gold and black bars look basically the same for these three sites, which means that the increase is due to the shrub -> grassland crosswalk; the crosswalk for savanna does not seem to matter, likely because there is very little savanna at these sites. This pattern also holds for Iraq, which had about 2% shrubland (compared to 49% desert, 42% cropland, 4% grassland, and 2% urban). -->

<!-- 2. Sites with significant area in savanna (Goias, Mato Grosso, and Chongqing, though I know this isn’t really “savanna”) show greater similarity when savanna is classed as grassland, not as forest (this makes sense, given that these sites likely have a greater distinction between true forest and savanna). The green and gold bars are the same, signifying that the shrubland decision doesn’t matter much (because there is so little shrubland there). -->

<!-- 3. The four remaining sites - Nebraska, Orenburg, Shaanxi, and Volgograd - are all in grassland/steppe biomes, where the majority of the site is classified as grassland. At these places, the similarity is higher when shrubland is classified as forest (shown by the green and gray bars being higher). These increases are pretty small, however, and there is relatively little shrubland at any of these sites (max. 1.4% at Nebraska) -->

## Results of statistical tests comparing proportion of winners and losers by species group {#si-prop-test-results}

Throughout this analysis, we used two-sample Z-tests to test for equality between the proportion of species with statistically significant gains (or losses) of habitat for various groups of interest. 
These Z-tests applied Yates' continuity correction and were two-sided.
Mammals and birds showed statistically significant differences in the proportion of both winner and loser species following abandonment.
Mammals showed a significantly higher proportion of species that were winners than birds did (reported in main text), and also a significantly lower proportion of species that were losers [$X^2$ (df = `r p_test_loss_m_v_b$parameter`, *N* = `r sum(aoh_gain_bird_v_mam_tmp$N)`) = `r round(p_test_loss_m_v_b$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_loss_m_v_b$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_loss_m_v_b$p.value, digits = 2)))`].

When comparing the proportion of winner species between threatened (i.e., Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered) and non-threatened species (summed across mammals and birds), we found that the difference between these two proportions was not statistically significant [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_iucn_all$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_by_iucn_tmp %>% filter(aoh_type == "crop_abn_iucn") %>% .$N %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_iucn_all$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_iucn_all$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_iucn_all$p.value, digits = 2)))`].
This pattern held for Calculation 2 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_iucn_all_calc2$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_by_iucn_tmp %>% filter(aoh_type == "max_abn_iucn") %>% .$N %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_iucn_all_calc2$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_iucn_all_calc2$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_iucn_all_calc2$p.value, digits = 2)))`] and Calculation 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_iucn_all_calc3$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_by_iucn_tmp %>% filter(aoh_type == "full_iucn") %>% .$N %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_iucn_all_calc3$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_iucn_all_calc3$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_iucn_all_calc3$p.value, digits = 2)))`]. 
This was also the case for birds [$X^2$ (df = `r p_test_iucn_bird$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_by_iucn_tmp %>% filter(aoh_type == "crop_abn_iucn", vert_class == "bird") %>% .$N %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_iucn_bird$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_iucn_bird$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_iucn_bird$p.value, digits = 2)))`] and mammals [$X^2$ (df = `r p_test_iucn_mam$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_by_iucn_tmp %>% filter(aoh_type == "crop_abn_iucn", vert_class == "mam") %>% .$N %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_iucn_mam$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_iucn_mam$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_iucn_mam$p.value, digits = 2)))`] individually.
When looking at individual IUCN statuses, we found a similar, but weaker, pattern; this is unsurprising, given that most threat categories contained relatively few species (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-iucn)).

To understand the effect of recultivation on species' responses to abandonment, we compared the proportion of species with increasing trends in AOH to the potential proportion in a scenario in which no recultivation took place.
The proportions of winners showed statistically significant increases when recultivation did not take place, for both birds [$X^2$ (df = `r obs_v_pot_stats$bird_gain_p_test$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_overall_obs_v_pot_tmp %>% filter(vert_class == "bird", overall_trend == "gain") %>% .$N %>% sum()`) = `r round(obs_v_pot_stats$bird_gain_p_test$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(obs_v_pot_stats$bird_gain_p_test$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(obs_v_pot_stats$bird_gain_p_test$p.value, digits = 2)))`] and mammals [$X^2$ (df = `r obs_v_pot_stats$mam_gain_p_test$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_overall_obs_v_pot_tmp %>% filter(vert_class == "mam", overall_trend == "gain") %>% .$N %>% sum()`) = `r round(obs_v_pot_stats$mam_gain_p_test$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(obs_v_pot_stats$mam_gain_p_test$p.value < 0.01, "< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(obs_v_pot_stats$mam_gain_p_test$p.value, digits = 2)))`]

We also compared proportions of winners and losers across three calculations of AOH with progressively wider temporal and spatial scope (see Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-sample-trajectories)).
For birds, the difference between the proportion of consistent winners was statistically significant between Calculation 1 and 2 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_gain_bird_by_calc12$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_bird_by_calc_tmp$N[1:2] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc12$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc12$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc12$p.value, digits = 2)))`], Calculation 1 and 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_gain_bird_by_calc13$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_bird_by_calc_tmp$N[c(1,3)] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc13$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc13$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc13$p.value, digits = 2)))`], and Calculation 2 and 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_gain_bird_by_calc23$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_bird_by_calc_tmp$N[2:3] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc23$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc23$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc23$p.value, digits = 2)))`].
For mammals, the difference between the proportion of consistent winners was statistically significant for Calculation 1 and 2 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_gain_mam_by_calc12$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_mam_by_calc_tmp$N[1:2] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc12$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc12$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc12$p.value, digits = 2)))`] and Calculation 1 and 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_gain_mam_by_calc13$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_mam_by_calc_tmp$N[c(1,3)] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc13$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc13$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc13$p.value, digits = 2)))`], but not for Calculation 2 and 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_gain_mam_by_calc23$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_mam_by_calc_tmp$N[2:3] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc23$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc23$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc23$p.value, digits = 2)))`].

The proportions of consistent losers also showed significant differences for birds between Calculation 1 and 2 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_loss_bird_by_calc12$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_loss_bird_by_calc_tmp$N[1:2] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc12$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc12$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc12$p.value, digits = 2)))`] and Calculation 1 and 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_loss_bird_by_calc13$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_loss_bird_by_calc_tmp$N[c(1,3)] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc13$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc13$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc13$p.value, digits = 2)))`], but not for Calculation 2 and 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_loss_bird_by_calc23$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_loss_bird_by_calc_tmp$N[2:3] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc23$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc23$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc23$p.value, digits = 2)))`].
We found the same pattern for mammals, where the difference between proportion of consistent winners was statistically significant for all pairs of calculations: Calculation 1 and 2 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_loss_mam_by_calc12$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_loss_mam_by_calc_tmp$N[1:2] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc12$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc12$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc12$p.value, digits = 2)))`] and Calculation 1 and 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_loss_mam_by_calc13$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_loss_mam_by_calc_tmp$N[c(1,3)] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc13$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc13$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc13$p.value, digits = 2)))`], but not for Calculation 2 and 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_loss_mam_by_calc23$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_loss_mam_by_calc_tmp$N[2:3] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc23$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc23$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc23$p.value, digits = 2)))`].

## Trends in Mato Grosso, Brazil {#si-mato-grosso}

Limiting recultivation in Mato Grosso would have affected a large number of species given this site's high species richness.
Here, `r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_improve_n_total` additional species (`r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_improve_n_bird_no_trend` bird and `r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_improve_n_mam_no_trend` mammal species) showed significant gains in habitat in our scenario in which recultivation was prevented (Calculation 1b), transitioning from having no significant trend in our base calculation of observed cropland abandonment (Calculation 1).
On average, each of these species gained `r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_improve_mean_p_gain`% more AOH by the end of the time series in the scenario of recultivation prevention (Calculation 1b) than was actually observed (Calculation 1).
For comparison, only `r obs_v_pot_stats$n_sp_improve_non_mg_bird` bird and `r obs_v_pot_stats$n_sp_improve_non_mg_mam` mammal species across all sites outside of Mato Grosso changed to significant gains in our scenario of recultivation prevention.
Meanwhile, `r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_worsen_n_bird_mam` total species at Mato Grosso had their AOH trend worsen under our recultivation prevention scenario (Calculation 1b; `r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_n_bird_gain_to_loss` bird and `r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_n_mam_gain_to_loss` mammal species transitioning from significant gains to significant losses, and `r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_n_bird_no_trend_to_loss` bird species transitioning from no trend to significant losses).
AOH declined for these species by `r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_worsen_mean_p_loss`% on average relative to observed abandonment (Calculation 1).

## Modeling the effect of species traits on responses to abandonment {#si-traits}

Our analysis of the effect of species’ ecological traits (see Table \@ref(tab:traits-mod-table-main) for results, and Table \@ref(tab:trait-variables-table) for descriptions of the predictor trait variables) on their responses to cropland abandonment focused on three response variables: (1) the AOH trend (binary, gain or loss), (2) the AOH change as a percent of site area, and (3) the ratio of AOH at the end and start of the time series (natural log transformed).
These three models respectively provide insights on the association of species traits on 1) the likelihood of species experiencing statistically significant gains in habitat following cropland abandonment, 2) the overall magnitude of those changes, and 3) the magnitude of those changes relative to pre-existing habitat.

In addition to these primary models, we also fit models for variations on the binary AOH trend response variable.
Our primary specification (binary, Gain or Loss) excluded species without a significant trend in AOH, focusing only on whether a species showed a significant increasing trend or a significant decreasing trend. 
We also explored three additional binary AOH trend response variables: (4) whether a species had a significant increasing trend (Gain or Non-Gain, including both declining species and no trend species); (5) whether a species had a significant decreasing trend (Loss or Non-Loss, including both increasing species and no trend species), and (6) whether a species had no significant trend (No Trend / Trend, including both increasing and decreasing significant trends). 
These model results are shown in Table \@ref(tab:traits-mod-table-binary), alongside the primary binary Gain / Loss (1) specification from the main text.
When including no trend species, more generalist species (i.e., those with a greater number of Level 2 IUCN suitable habitats) are more likely to be winners than non-winners (4) and less likely to be losers than non-losers (5) (Table \@ref(tab:traits-mod-table-binary)): for each additional IUCN Level 2 suitable habitat, the odds of being a winner over a non-winner (4) increased by 6%.
This coefficient was not statistically significant in our primary model (1).
A range of factors were associated with a species being more likely not to have a statistically significant trend in any direction, including savanna and shrubland suitability, and greater distance from the equator (Table \@ref(tab:traits-mod-table-binary)).
Species in sites that experienced more abandonment were less likely to have no trend. 
In this model, rocky, caves, and desert habitats did not have significant associations, nor did vertebrate class, IUCN threat status, trophic level, body mass, or range area.

The lack of a significant effect of forest habitat suitability on the overall magnitude of AOH, and the negative effect of savanna and shrubland habitat suitability on the log ratio of final to starting AOH, may be simply due to the fact that much less of abandoned cropland in our sites ended up in these types of habitats relative to grassland and savanna (e.g., much less abandonment transitioned into forest at our sites; Crawford et al. 2022, Fig. S23). 
Species in sites that experienced relatively more abandonment also gained relatively more habitat. 
Each percentage point increase in abandonment as a share of each site was associated with an increase in AOH of `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "max_abn")) %>% pull(estimate)`% of site area and an increasing the relative gain in AOH by a factor of `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "log_ratio", str_detect(term, "max_abn")) %>% pull(estimate)`.

Modeled trait associations are not markedly different when assuming no recultivation took place ("recultivation prevention" scenarios).


### Additional model specifications

Whether arable land is suitable habitat for a species is the strongest predictor of whether a species will gain or lose habitat following cropland abandonment.
When excluding arable land and urban land suitability as predictors in our models, a range of other predictors become statistically significant, including habitat breadth, vertebrate class, and trophic level (Table \@ref(tab:traits-mod3-table)).
For example, when excluding arable land suitability as a predictor in the binary models, savanna habitat suitability is no longer statistically significant, as is wetland habitat suitability.
In this model specification, habitat breadth, vertebrate class, trophic level, range area, tropicality, and abandonment extent now start playing a statistically significant role.
However, in this constrained model, the coefficients on the habitat breadth predictor change sign, such that more generalist species are now associated with losing AOH.
While it is possible that this represents a true relationship, indicating that more generalist species are more likely to lose habitat as a result of abandonment, it may be more likely that these newly significant coefficients rather reflect aspects of traits that are (relatively weak) proxy indications for whether a species occurs in arable lands.

(ref:caption-aoh-sample-trajectories) An illustration of the pixels included in each of our three AOH calculations. Land cover trajectories are shown for 10 hypothetical pixels (y-axis), with land cover for each year shown in colors (x-axis). The first six of these pixels are classified as having been "abandoned" for a least a portion of our time series based on our definition, and the last four are not, as indicated by labels at far right. Portions of each pixel's trajectory that are excluded from each calculation are denoted by dotted lines and lighter colors. Calculation 1 (left) includes only habitat provided by abandoned pixels, excluding land cover in those pixels prior to cultivation. Calculation 2 (middle) includes only abandoned pixels but includes habitat in each year (thus factoring in pre-abandonment habitat loss). Calculation 3 (right) includes all pixels for the full time series (thus factoring in habitat loss elsewhere at the site). See text for details.
