# Abstract^[DW: will edit after next round of revisions] {.unnumbered}

Although agricultural expansion continues to drive habitat loss in many regions, substantial areas of cropland have been abandoned in recent decades following demographic shifts, socioeconomic and technological changes, and increased globalization.
Abandoned lands increasingly represent opportunities to restore ecosystems yet variation in the distribution of species and habitats, along with a lack of detailed maps of abandonment, have resulted in uncertainty and controversy over whether abandonment will benefit, or harm, biodiversity.
Here, we use annual land cover maps to estimate habitat area for 2023 bird and mammal species at 11 sites across 4 continents for 1987-2017.
We find that most birds (`r abstract_stats$percent_winner_bird_obs`%) and mammals (`r abstract_stats$percent_winner_mam_obs`%) gain habitat as a direct result of cropland abandonment.
However, frequent recultivation attenuated these benefits: even more species would have benefited (`r abstract_stats$percent_winner_bird_pot`% and `r abstract_stats$percent_winner_mam_pot`% respectively) if recultivation had not occurred.
Furthermore, most birds and about half of mammal species still had negative trends overall after accounting for land clearing for agriculture prior to or alongside abandonment, despite gains from abandonment.
While abandonment represents a conservation opportunity, limiting recultivation and reducing habitat loss remains critical for the future of biodiversity.

# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Habitat loss through the clearing of land for agriculture remains the most widespread threat to terrestrial biodiversity [@Tilman2017], and agricultural expansion continues to threaten many places [@Potapov2022].
Yet agricultural land use change is not unidirectional: amidst continued cropland expansion, hundreds of millions of hectares of agricultural lands around the world have been abandoned since 1950 due to socioeconomic, demographic, and technological changes [@ReyBenayas2007; @Li2017; @Potapov2022; @Chazdon2020].
As agriculture grows more efficient and rural outmigration, urbanization, and globalization continue, some expect abandonment to accelerate [@Sanderson2018; @Taylor2021], and environmentalists increasingly look to former agricultural lands for low-cost opportunities to restore ecosystems [@Navarro2012], sequester carbon [@Griscom2017; @Yang2020], and recover biodiversity [@Chazdon2020; @Xie2019; @Baumann2020].

Importantly, however, biodiversity is not guaranteed to benefit when cropland is abandoned.
At a fundamental level, spatial and temporal variation in abandonment will substantially affect biodiversity outcomes given that species have unique biophysical and habitat requirements and are not evenly distributed around the world.
More practically, the recovery of natural ecosystems requires time, typically multiple decades [@Acevedo-Charry2019; @Isbell2019; @Nerlekar2020], and if former fields are recultivated within a decade or two, as recent evidence suggests [@Crawford2022; @Dara2018], ecosystems are unlikely to accumulate substantial amounts of carbon or biodiversity.
Together, these factors have contributed to an ongoing controversy about the extent to which abandonment will benefit biodiversity [@Queiroz2014; @ReyBenayas2007].

This controversy is perhaps most apparent in Europe, where a substantial amount of conservation attention is placed on "farmland biodiversity:" species of conservation concern that are often dependent on open-habitats and low-intensity farmland, as a result of Europe's long history of cultivation, the loss of natural disturbance regimes, and cultural preferences [@Batary2015; @Fischer2008; @Fischer2012a].
When considering what could be lost, abandonment is often considered a threat that reduces landscape heterogeneity and the amount of open habitats, regardless of the potential for gains in other types of species [@Queiroz2014; @Navarro2012].
Given that species have unique responses to land use change [@Sirami2008; @Finch2019], conservationists need a more nuanced understanding of which species benefit, which are harmed, and how these patterns balance out across whole landscapes in order to improve how biodiversity is incorporated into policy responses to abandonment.

Though many studies have investigated the effect of abandonment on local biodiversity [@Bowen2007; @Sirami2008; @Uchida2014; @Plieninger2014; @Regos2016; @Isbell2019], few have attempted to investigate how abandonment affects biodiversity at the landscape scale by combining spatially-explicit biodiversity data with maps of abandonment.
Crucially, these maps have generally lacked the spatial and temporal resolution required to track abandonment dynamics through time.

Recent efforts to improve how abandonment is mapped from satellite imagery have produced annual maps of cropland abandonment with higher spatial resolution (30-m resolution) and temporal coverage (1987-2017) than previously available [@Yin2020]. 
These new time series data have enabled detailed analyses of the long-term persistence of abandoned cropland [@Crawford2022], and also support investigations into how abandonment affects individual species across multiple landscapes and longer time horizons.

Here, we combine high-resolution, annual land-cover time series for 11 sites on four continents [@Yin2020] with range maps and habitat preferences for 2023 species of birds and mammals to calculate changes in area of habitat (AOH) [@Brooks2019] resulting from cropland abandonment annually between 1987 and 2017.
We address three questions: 
(i) How did cropland abandonment affect habitat availability for individual bird and mammal species, and how does the balance of winners and losers vary across sites and a range of species traits?
(ii) To what extent did recultivation during our time series limit habitat gains following abandonment?
(iii) Finally, did changes in area of habitat resulting directly from abandonment compensate for broader habitat changes that occurred a) prior to cultivation and subsequent abandonment or b) elsewhere throughout the landscape?

By exploring how abandonment affected habitat availability for every bird and mammal species at our sites, we provide the most detailed examination to date of how recent cropland abandonment affected biodiversity across multiple spatial and temporal scales.
Our analysis demonstrates that cropland abandonment holds the potential to increase habitat area for most bird and mammal species across a broad range of sites that have recently experienced abandonment, yet that these gains rarely compensate for habitat loss that took place prior to or alongside abandonment, and are hindered by the recultivation of abandoned croplands.
Together, these results illuminate the limited but tangible benefits of cropland abandonment for biodiversity, and highlight opportunities to harness broad agricultural land-use transitions for conservation.

Overall, we found that most birds (`r aoh_stats_main$n_gain_bird_percent`%) and mammals (`r aoh_stats_main$n_gain_mam_percent`%) at our sites consistently gained habitat as a result of abandonment, experiencing statistically significant and positive trends in AOH everywhere they occurred (Table \@ref(tab:main-aoh-stats-table), Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn-prop)).
In contrast, only `r aoh_stats_main$n_loss_bird_percent`% of birds and `r aoh_stats_main$n_loss_mam_percent`% of mammals lost habitat consistently across sites (Table \@ref(tab:main-aoh-stats-table), Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn-prop)).
Some species exhibited contrasting trends at different sites, accounting for an additional `r aoh_stats_main$n_w_gain_bird_percent`% of birds and `r aoh_stats_main$n_w_gain_mam_percent`% of mammals that gained habitat at some but not all sites (i.e., “weak” gains), and `r aoh_stats_main$n_w_loss_bird_percent`% and `r aoh_stats_main$n_w_loss_mam_percent`% respectively that lost habitat at some but not all sites (i.e., “weak” losses; Table \@ref(tab:main-aoh-stats-table)).
The number of individual species-site trends are shown in Table \@ref(tab:aoh-stats-table-all-obs).

The ratio of winners to losers varied across sites, but remained consistently positive (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn-prop), Table \@ref(tab:aoh-stats-by-site)).
The lone exception were birds in Iraq (our site with the lowest species richness; Fig. \@ref(fig:richness-by-site)), where `r 100*(1-aoh_stats_main$wl_iraq)`% more birds lost habitat than gained (Figs. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn-prop) and \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn)).
In general, a greater share of mammal species gained habitat than birds species, both at individual sites (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-stacked)) and overall (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-overall-stacked-w-pot)) [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_gain_m_v_b$parameter`, *N* = `r sum(aoh_gain_bird_v_mam_tmp$N)`) = `r round(p_test_gain_m_v_b$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_gain_m_v_b$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_gain_m_v_b$p.value, digits = 2)))`].
Though few threatened species occurred at our sites (Fig. \@ref(fig:richness-by-site)), `r round(100*p_test_iucn_all$estimate[2], 2)`% gained habitat following abandonment (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-iucn-by-site-crop-abn)), though not disproportionately more or less than for non-threatened species [`r round(100*p_test_iucn_all$estimate[1], 2)`%; two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_iucn_all$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_by_iucn_tmp %>% .$N %>% sum()`) = `r prettyNum(round(p_test_iucn_all$statistic, digits = 2), nsmall = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_iucn_all$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_iucn_all$p.value, digits = 2)))`].
Even fewer small-ranged species occurred at our sites (3 birds and 6 mammals), yet nearly all gained habitat following abandonment (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-range)).

Though the vast majority of species’ trends were positive, species with declining trends lost a larger amount of habitat on average (`r effect_size_stats_tmp$mean_aoh_lost_percent_obs`% of site area) than those with increasing trends gained (`r effect_size_stats_tmp$mean_aoh_gained_percent_obs`% of site area; Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-change-percent-by-trend)).
However, the opposite pattern played out for changes in AOH relative to initial AOH: `r effect_size_stats_tmp$share_doubled_obs`% of winners doubled their habitat (or more), while only `r effect_size_stats_tmp$share_halved_obs`% of losers halved their habitat (or worse; Fig. \@ref(fig:log-ratio-aoh-change-by-site)).

To explore which ecological factors are associated with species' responses to cropland abandonment, we fit three linear models using species traits to predict 1) AOH trend (gain or loss), 2) magnitude of AOH change (as a percent of site area), and 3) relative change in AOH (the ratio of final to initial AOH, log transformed).
We found that habitat suitability -- the primary factor determining a species' area of habitat -- had a significant effect on abandonment responses.
Grassland, forest, and savanna habitat suitability all increased the odds of a species gaining AOH, with grassland suitability being the most consequential (increasing the odds of being a winner by a factor of `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "binary", str_detect(term, "grassland")) %>% pull(estimate)`, compared to `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "binary", str_detect(term, "forest")) %>% pull(estimate)` and `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "binary", str_detect(term, "savanna")) %>% pull(estimate)` for forest and savanna suitability respectively; Table \@ref(tab:traits-mod-table-main)).
Grassland and savanna suitability were also associated with larger increases in AOH overall, adding `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "grassland")) %>% pull(estimate)`% and `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "sav")) %>% pull(estimate)`% of site area. 
Grassland and forest suitability led to larger relative increases in AOH over time (increasing by a factor of `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "log_ratio", str_detect(term, "grassland")) %>% pull(estimate)` and `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "log_ratio", str_detect(term, "for")) %>% pull(estimate)` respectively), but savanna and shrubland suitability led to smaller relative gains (reducing AOH by `r 100 * (1-filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "log_ratio", str_detect(term, "sav")) %>% pull(estimate))`% and `r 100 * (1-filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "log_ratio", str_detect(term, "shrub")) %>% pull(estimate))`% respectively, Table \@ref(tab:traits-mod-table-main)).
Wetland, rocky habitat, and urban area suitability were each associated with losing AOH, but arable land suitability was far and away the strongest predictor that a species would lose habitat following abandonment, being associated with a `r 100 * (1-filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "binary", str_detect(term, "arable")) %>% pull(estimate))`% decline in the odds of being a winner, an AOH reduction of `r -1 * (filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "arable")) %>% pull(estimate))`% of site area, and a `r 100 * (1-filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "log_ratio", str_detect(term, "arable")) %>% pull(estimate))`% relative reduction in the AOH over time.

Species with a greater number of suitable habitats and larger ranges saw larger increases in AOH, gaining `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "n_suitable")) %>% pull(estimate)`% of site area for each additional suitable habitat and `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "range")) %>% pull(estimate)`% of site area for each order of magnitude increase in range size. 
Tropical species also benefited more: for each additional degree of latitude a species' range move away from the equator, AOH declined by `r -1*(filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "latitude")) %>% pull(estimate))`% of site area.
Range area and tropicality were also associated with larger relative gains in AOH.
Cave suitability, desert suitability, vertebrate class, IUCN threat status, trophic level, and body mass did not have significant associations across any of our models (Table \@ref(tab:traits-mod-table-main)).

## Effects of recultivation on habitat area {.unnumbered}

Many abandoned croplands were recultivated during our time series (38.05% on average across sites @Crawford2022), with substantial impacts on species’ AOH. Had no recultivation taken place during our time series, the percentage of consistent winners would have increased `r paste0("from ", aoh_stats_main$n_gain_bird_percent, "% to ", obs_v_pot_stats$n_gain_bird_pot_percent, "% for birds and ", aoh_stats_main$n_gain_mam_percent, "% to ", obs_v_pot_stats$n_gain_mam_pot_percent, "% for mammals")` (Table \@ref(tab:main-aoh-stats-table), Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-obs-v-pot-by-site)), both statistically significant increases (see SI Section \@ref(si-prop-test-results)).
Yet while the number of winners would have increased, so too would the number of losers, from `r aoh_stats_main$n_loss_bird_percent`% to `r obs_v_pot_stats$n_loss_bird_pot_percent`% for birds and `r aoh_stats_main$n_loss_mam_percent`% to `r obs_v_pot_stats$n_loss_mam_pot_percent`% for mammals (Table \@ref(tab:main-aoh-stats-table)).

The majority of these changes took place at Mato Grosso, where an additional `r filter(n_aoh_trend_changes_by_site_df, site == "mato_grosso")$gain` species gained AOH and an additional `r filter(n_aoh_trend_changes_by_site_df, site == "mato_grosso")$loss` lost AOH. Aside from Chongqing (`r filter(n_aoh_trend_changes_by_site_df, site == "chongqing")$gain` additional winners, `r filter(n_aoh_trend_changes_by_site_df, site == "chongqing")$loss` additional losers) and Nebraska / Wyoming (`r filter(n_aoh_trend_changes_by_site_df, site == "nebraska")$gain` additional winners), all other sites experienced fewer than 3 additional winners or losers (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-obs-v-pot-by-site), Table \@ref(tab:aoh-changes-obs-v-pot)).
Even when trends did not change direction, preventing recultivation would have amplified the magnitude of AOH changes, with winners gaining and losers losing more habitat (Figs. \@ref(fig:aoh-p-change-obs-v-pot-bird)-\@ref(fig:aoh-p-change-obs-v-pot-mam)).
This effect was more intense for losers, who lost on average `r obs_v_pot_stats$mean_p_loss_same`% more habitat, while winners only gained on average `r obs_v_pot_stats$mean_p_gain_same`% more habitat.

## Abandonment in the context of broader land cover changes {.unnumbered}

Our analysis so far has focused directly on cropland abandonment by exclusively considering the habitat provided by abandoned croplands during cultivation, subsequent abandonment, and potential recultivation.
Though abandonment benefitted many more species than it harmed (Table \@ref(tab:main-aoh-stats-table)), did it compensate for 1) habitat that was cleared for croplands prior to abandonment (i.e., the net change in abandoned lands) or 2) habitat loss that occurred elsewhere throughout the site?
When considering the net AOH change in abandoned lands or throughout the entire landscape at each site, the balance of winners to losers becomes much less favorable (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-overall)).
In both broader AOH calculations, more bird species lost habitat than gained, and about equal numbers of mammals lost as gained, maintaining only a marginally positive ratio of winners to losers (Table \@ref(tab:main-aoh-stats-table), Figs. \@ref(fig:aoh-overall-stacked-w-pot) and \@ref(fig:aoh-overall-w-pot)).
Both declines in the share of winning species were statistically significant (see SI Section \@ref(si-prop-test-results)).

While the number of losing species increased at all sites when factoring in broader land cover changes (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-stacked)), these increases were most severe in Mato Grosso, Brazil, where relatively less abandonment and relatively more land cover change occurred than at other sites, affecting a large number of tropical forest species (see site-specific results in Figs. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-max-abn) and \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-full)).
Our sites in Bosnia & Herzegovnia; Chongqing, China; Goiás, Brazil; and Iraq also showed negative ratios of winners to losers when factoring in broader land cover changes, but sites elsewhere managed to narrowly maintain positive ratios (particularly for mammal species), despite these ratios declining overall.
A greater share of threatened species also lost habitat when factoring in habitat loss that occurred prior to or alongside abandonment, but not statistically more so than non-threatened species (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-iucn-lumped)).
As before, limiting recultivation would have reduced the number of losing species in both of these broader AOH calculations, and in this case would have resulted in a positive ratio of winners to losers even after factoring in habitat clearing for agriculture prior to abandonment (Figs. \@ref(fig:aoh-overall-stacked-w-pot) and \@ref(fig:aoh-overall-w-pot)).
Limiting recultivation would have had a similar but much smaller effect when considering AOH changes through the full site, however.

Columns correspond to three different AOH calculations: 1) abandonment only, from first cultivation through 2017; 2) net change in abandoned lands, from 1987-2017 (accounting for habitat clearing for agriculture prior to abandonment); and 3) the entire landscape at each site, from 1987-2017.

# Discussion {.unnumbered}

The growing, global trend of cropland abandonment has reshaped agricultural landscapes around the world.
Our results show that abandonment has directly increased habitat availability for the majority of bird and mammal species at a variety of sites around the world (Fig \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn-prop)).
These gains were largely explained by species' habitat suitability, but species with larger ranges, ranges closer to the equator, or a greater number of suitable habitats were also more likely to gain habitat following abandonment.
On the whole, bird species were more sensitive to habitat losses following abandonment than mammals, though a majority still gained habitat overall.
The overall proportion of winners did not differ significantly for threatened species (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-iucn-by-site-crop-abn)) or small-ranged species (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-range)) relative to other species, and we are encouraged by the fact that the majority of these species experienced gains in AOH.
<!-- Contrary to the concerns of some conservationists [@Queiroz2014], these species of conservation concern were not more likely to lose habitat following abandonment [@Wright2012]. -->

However, habitat gains from abandonment were not uniform across species and sites, and placing abandonment in the context of broader land cover changes showed that abandonment rarely compensated for the initial land clearing for agriculture prior to abandonment or habitat loss elsewhere at each site.
Most concerningly, these gains were dampened by frequent recultivation of abandoned croplands: the ephemerality of abandonment reduced both the overall share of species with increasing trends (Figs. \@ref(fig:aoh-overall) and \@ref(fig:aoh-obs-v-pot-by-site), Table \@ref(tab:aoh-changes-obs-v-pot)) and the magnitude of AOH gained during our study period (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-change-percent-by-trend-obs-v-pot)).
Despite the clear potential for abandonment to contribute substantial amounts of habitat to bird and mammal species, expectations for abandonment to produce overall gains across landscapes that are still experiencing habitat loss and recultivation must be tempered accordingly.

Our sites broadly represent landscapes with documented recent histories of cropland abandonment but cover a range of different biomes, where differences in species communities, species richness, and the distributions of habitats produced unique responses to abandonment (Fig. \@ref(fig:site-biomes)).
Though we only had three sites in the tropics (Figs. \@ref(fig:global-map-w-wisc)a and \@ref(fig:site-biomes)), these sites showed the highest number of winning species, led by sites in Mato Grosso and Goiás, Brazil (Table \@ref(tab:aoh-stats-by-site); Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn)).
Tropical regions have the largest overall benefits from abandonment (but also correspondingly large risks due to habitat loss), in part due to high species richness, but also due to high sensitivity to habitat modification -- a smaller share of these species are likely to persist in artificial habitats (Fig. \@ref(fig:p-arable-suitability)). 
However, we note that Mato Grosso experienced the least abandonment of any site and remained dominated by habitat loss, which led to relatively small gains in AOH (one or two orders of magnitude less for individual species than other sites; Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-sp-obs-crop-abn)) and the greatest share of species with losing trends when accounting for land cover changes throughout the site (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-stacked)).
Though less speciose, our sites in temperate grassland biomes (Volgograd, Russia; Orenburg, Russia / Uralsk, Kazakhstan; Nebraska / Wyoming, USA) had among the highest shares of winners overall ($\geq 80$%; Table \@ref(tab:aoh-stats-by-site), Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn-prop)).

Interestingly, Iraq showed the most unfavorable response to abandonment, with a higher proportion of species declining following abandonment than any other site, even after accounting for broader land cover changes at other sites (except Mato Grosso; Table \@ref(tab:aoh-stats-by-site), Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-site-crop-abn-prop)).
These overall negative trends may stem from a relative lack of desert suitability: only 19% of birds and 67% of mammals in this site occur in desert habitat.
However, it could also reflect its long history of human cultivation [@Balter2007; @Batary2015], throughout which species may have adapted to utilize anthropogenic habitats, particularly if irrigated farming increased water availability for desert-dwelling species.

Our overall positive results contrast with much of the existing literature on biodiversity and abandonment.
A review of previous studies [@Queiroz2014] showed that most site-specific studies reported that abandonment had negative effects on biodiversity overall. 
However, these outcomes substantially varied by taxonomic focus, metrics, agricultural system, and the framing of pre-abandonment losses and post-abandonment gains.
Research perspectives on abandonment also varied by region (with predominantly negative views of abandonment in Europe and Asia), potentially the result of differences in conservation focus (e.g., which species are considered, and at what scale), or geographic differences in biodiversity outcomes.

Our site results echo the heterogeneous species responses shown by prior studies [@Sirami2008;@Regos2016], but portray a more positive view abandonment overall.
Though lacking sites in Western or Central Europe, where previous studies have shown abandonment-related biodiversity declines, our sites in Eastern Europe, Russia, and China showed positive effects overall.
Negative responses to abandonment (e.g., in our site in Iraq and parts of Europe) may be regionally restricted, at least for birds and mammals.
The benefits of abandonment may be obscured by recultivation or broader land cover trends, which our results show can produce overall declines despite compensatory gains from abandonment.

However, species with statistically significant losses in habitat area (`r aoh_stats_main$n_loss_bird + aoh_stats_main$n_loss_mam` species across our sites) cannot be written off, especially where the majority of a community loses habitat or where species show particularly steep habitat declines.
Though a strategy of encouraging habitat regeneration following abandonment would benefit most birds and mammals at almost all of our sites, species that stand to lose habitat from this approach should be monitored, and when necessary, incorporated into conservation planning efforts to ameliorate habitat losses, with particular attention given to the maintenance of high-biodiversity open habitats that support threatened or rare species.
Such conservation efforts, designed to foster habitat regeneration on abandoned croplands while maintaining habitats for species losing habitat due to abandonment when necessary, are most likely to be successful when developed in collaboration with local communities [@DiSacco2021].
<!-- The socioeconomic and cultural challenges that abandonment often present to rural communities are difficult to separate from perceptions of the impact of abandonment on biodiversity, and disagreements about the effect of abandonment on biodiversity must also be understood in the context of these social factors [@Beilin2014; @VanderZanden2017; @Barnaud2021]. -->
<!-- The nuances of our site-by-site results make clear that each region should be considered separately, and conservation approaches that factor in distinct communities of species with varying responses to abandonment [@Finch2020] will be best equipped to make the most of abandonment. -->

A few limitations to this study should be highlighted.
First, our analysis is based on remotely-sensed land cover interpolated to specific habitat types as delineated by IUCN [@IUCN2021] and BirdLife International [@BirdLife2021], which do not provide a reliable proxy for habitat quality, particularly when quality is related to regeneration time. 
Former agricultural land can yield valuable habitat, but regeneration can take multiple decades (often >50 years) to recover to similar species richness or community compositions of intact ecosystems [@Acevedo-Charry2019; @Isbell2019; @Nerlekar2020]. 
We manually excluded species that are known to require habitat older than 30 years (precluding any habitat gains during our study period), but it will also undoubtedly take time for non-mature habitat species to return to these habitats as they regenerate.
However, if post-abandonment successional habitats are protected from recultivation, the composition of species in these habitats will change over time, with early-successional species gradually being replaced by mature habitat specialists.
The gains we report are optimistic and require on-the-ground conservation action to fully realize, yet if regeneration is protected for long enough, an even greater number of species could potentially benefit.

We recognize that post-abandonment habitats will not be uniformly suitable for species, even as a function of age.
Several factors affect the speed and success of natural regeneration [@Chazdon2016], including legacies of cultivation (e.g., invasive plants, residual pesticides, etc.), proximity of source populations of plants and animals, and changes to natural disturbance regimes.
These factors are particularly challenging for grasslands and other open habitats, which are frequently maintained through grazing or fire; when these disturbances are absent, as is common following abandonment, open-habitat specialists may be harmed if croplands are replaced by woody regrowth [@ReyBenayas2007; @Nerlekar2020; @VanderZanden2017].

While birds and mammals are often used as general indicators for biodiversity [@Westgate2017], the patterns we find may not necessarily hold for other taxonomic groups, particularly when it comes to the abandonment of specific types of agriculture.
For example, the abandonment of rice paddy agriculture in Japan has been associated with large declines in the abundance and species richness of many fish, amphibian, and plant species, alongside moderate increases for bird and mammal species [@Koshida2018].
We excluded amphibians and reptiles from our study due to a relative lack of information about their distributions, habitat requirements, and threat status.
Finally, although our study sites covered 4 continents, they were restricted in area and we were unable to assess how cropland abandonment affected habitat availability across the full range of any species, which would be required to estimate changes in extinction risk (together with estimated population trends over time).

By connecting a high-resolution time series of cropland abandonment with species-specific distribution and habitat data for the first time, we provide evidence that cropland abandonment produced substantial gains in habitat for a majority of bird and mammal species over 30 years.
After accounting for the unique responses of individual species, we show that abandonment is unlikely to disproportionately harm species of conservation concern, and instead respresents an opportunity for most birds and mammals.
Yet despite these encouraging results, our additional analysis of abandonment in the context of broader land cover changes reinforce an inconvenient and ugly truth in conservation: land cover change remains a fundamental threat to species that must be addressed. 
Even in regions with substantial amounts of abandonment, potential gains infrequently outweigh habitat losses that took place prior to or alongside abandonment. 
In order to unlock the conservation potential of abandoned croplands, habitat loss prevention remains as critical as ever, while simultaneously working to reduce or postpone the recultivation of abandoned croplands through incentives and community initiatives. 
Only if the habitat gains from abandonment are sustained and enhanced can the broad changes reshaping agricultural landscapes begin to bend the curve of biodiversity loss.

# Methods {.unnumbered}

## Abandonment maps and definitions {.unnumbered}

Our analysis builds on a 30-m annual land cover time series [@Yin2020] produced for 11 sites from 1987-2017 (Figs. \@ref(fig:lc-1987) and \@ref(fig:lc-2017)).
These sites, ranging from `r round(min(area_summary_df$total_site_area_ha_2017/10^6), digits = 2)` million to `r round(max(area_summary_df$total_site_area_ha_2017/10^6), digits = 2)` million ha (Mha) in area, were selected to represent areas with documented histories of cropland abandonment and cover a range of biomes across 4 continents, including drylands, temperate regions, and the sub-tropic and wet tropics (Fig. \@ref(fig:global-map-w-wisc)a).
We excluded 3 of the 14 sites originally mapped by Yin et al. [@Yin2020] due to low classification accuracy, following Crawford et al. [@Crawford2022].
This time series mapped four land cover classes at high accuracy (average overall accuracy of $85\pm4$% [@Yin2020]): (i) cropland, (ii) herbaceous vegetation (e.g., grassland), (iii) woody vegetation (e.g., forest), and (iv) non-vegetation (e.g., water, barren, or urban land).
Previous work [@Crawford2022] mapped abandoned croplands by identifying periods of non-cropland (i.e., herbaceous or woody vegetation) that followed periods of cultivation and remained non-cropland for five or more consecutive years, following a commonly used five-year abandonment definition designed to exclude short-term fallow cycles [@FAO2016].
We used these abandonment maps to identify all pixels that were abandoned at least once during the time series (which we refer to as "abandoned pixels;" Figs. \@ref(fig:abn-lc-1987) and \@ref(fig:abn-lc-2017)).

## Calculating Area of Habitat from species range maps and habitat preferences {.unnumbered}

We next calculate each species' area of habitat (AOH [@Brooks2019]), defined as the total area of a species range that falls within suitable habitats and elevations.
We sourced range maps for all bird and mammal species from Birdlife International [@BirdLife2021] and the IUCN [@IUCN2021] respectively, and extracted habitat and elevation preferences from IUCN assessments. 
We excluded marine species and species classified as "Extinct" (EX) or "Extinct in the Wild" (EW), and only considered areas where species were considered “extant” and either "native" or "reintroduced," leaving 1495 bird and 528 mammal species (2023 total) with ranges overlapping at least one of our 11 sites.
For species with range maps delineated by season, we only consider areas where species are “resident,” “breeding,” or “non-breeding” (we exclude “passage” areas for migratory species).
For these species, we only considered those habitats marked as "suitable" in the relevant season associated with that portion of the range.
After filtering these species by elevation and seasonally-specific habitat preferences, the number of bird and mammal species with habitat within at least one site fell to 1688 (1175 birds and 513 mammals), with 1533 being directly affected by abandonment (1035 birds and 498 mammals).

We defined species as "threatened" when assessed by the IUCN as "Vulnerable," "Endangered," or "Critically Endangered," and "not threatened" when assessed as "Near Threatened" or "Least Concern."
Species assessed as "Data Deficient" are excluded from any analysis of threat status.
We classified a species as "small-ranged" if their total global range area (extent of occurrence) fell below the global median (following Jenkins et al. [@Jenkins2013]).
Because species' habitat preferences listed in IUCN assessments do not directly account for the successional age of the habitat, we conservatively excluded from our analysis all species that require mature habitats in at least one season.
Forest-dwelling bird and mammal species were classified as mature forest obligates if they required habitats older than 30 years (i.e., the maximum age of abandoned croplands during our time series), according to habitat descriptions listed in IUCN assessments and individual species accounts in The Handbook of the Birds of the World [@BOW2022] and The Handbook of the Mammals of the World [@HMW2019].
Neotropical bird species were independently verified by R. Alex Wiebe, an experienced Neotropical ornithologist (R.A. Wiebe, pers. comm.).
This resulted in the exclusion of 187 species of birds and 33 species of mammals, leaving 855 and 467 mammals total in our analyses.
The number of species at each site is shown according to threat status, habitat age requirements, and range size in Figs. \@ref(fig:richness-by-site) and \@ref(fig:richness-by-site-small).

## Translating from land cover to IUCN habitat types {.unnumbered}

Because AOH is calculated from habitat, not land cover, we translated the Yin et al. @Yin2020 land cover maps to match the IUCN's listed habitat types using a 100-m global map of IUCN habitat types for the year 2015 [@Jung2020a], resampled to 30-m resolution to match our land cover maps.
First, we developed a simple crosswalk between the coarse land cover types (e.g., forest) mapped by Yin et al. [@Yin2020] and the specific IUCN Level 2 habitat types (e.g., temperate forest), based on how each habitat type would likely be classified from satellite imagery (see Table \@ref(tab:iucn-crosswalk-table)).
Because this crosswalk delineates "one to many" relationships (i.e., one land cover class could be multiple IUCN habitat types), we next assigned individual pixels of land cover to the most common corresponding IUCN habitat type within the surrounding pixels in the Jung et al. [@Jung2020a] habitat map (see SI Section \@ref(si-habitat-assignment)).

## Calculating AOH across multiple temporal and spatial scales {.unnumbered}

To isolate the direct effect of cropland abandonment on habitat availability, we first calculated the area of habitat provided by pixels that were abandoned at some point during the time series ("Calculation 1;" Figs. \@ref(fig:abn-lc-1987)-\@ref(fig:abn-lc-2017)). 
For this calculation, we excluded habitat provided by these pixels before each pixel's first year of cultivation during the time series in order to isolate the change from cropland to abandoned cropland, therefore considering only habitat provided by croplands when they were actively cultivated, abandoned, or, where appropriate, recultivated (see Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-sample-trajectories)).

In order to put the direct effect of abandonment on AOH into a broader context of habitat loss and land cover change at each site, we calculated AOH in two additional ways (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-sample-trajectories)).
Calculation 2 considered changes in habitat that took place exclusively in pixels that experienced abandonment at some point during the time series (following Calculation 1), but now measured for the full time series, from 1987 through 2017.
This allows us to consider the habitat contributions of abandonment relative to a simple baseline set to 1987 (the start of our time series), accounting for any land cover that was cleared for agriculture prior to abandonment.

Finally, we calculated AOH for each species across the entire landscape at each site ("Calculation 3") for the full time series (1987-2017; Figs. \@ref(fig:lc-1987)-\@ref(fig:lc-2017)).
This calculation placed abandonment into the context of broader land cover change dynamics at each site and allowed us to consider the extent to which abandonment compensated for land-cover changes taking place alongside of abandonment.

In an earlier study, Crawford et al. [@Crawford2022] showed that while substantial abandonment occurred at our eleven study sites (8.76 Mha of croplands were abandoned one or more times from 1987-2017), this abandonment was relatively short-lived and subject to high rates of recultivation (only 6.06 Mha of croplands remained abandoned as of 2017, with a mean age of 14.22 years).
In order to calculate the impact of recultivation on abandonment's effect on AOH, we also applied a scenario of "potential abandonment" in which no recultivation took place after abandonment (following Crawford et al. [@Crawford2022]) to each of our three calculations of AOH.
In these scenarios, abandoned croplands were left abandoned from the year of initial abandonment through the end of the time series.

## Summarizing AOH trends {.unnumbered}

We extracted trends in AOH over time for each bird and mammal species at each site by parameterizing linear regressions to predict AOH as a function of year (converting raw AOH observations, shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-sp-obs-crop-abn), into trend lines, shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-trend-lines-crop-abn)).
In order to account for temporal autocorrelation present in individual species' trends in AOH (Fig. \@ref(fig:dw-stat)), we calculated the standard errors around the coefficient estimates with the Newey-West estimator [@Newey1987], a method designed to account for temporal autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity commonly used in the analysis of time series data, implemented using the fixest R package [@R-fixest].

AOH trends for a given species were classified as either gains or losses of habitat over time when slope coefficients were positive or negative, respectively, and statistically significant ($p<0.05$, i.e., the 95% confidence interval of the slope coefficient did not overlap with zero. 
We refer to these species as "winners" and "losers," respectively.
Species with AOH slopes that were not statistically significant ($p\geq0.05$) at a given site were classified as having "no trend."

Because each species could occur at multiple sites, there were some cases where an individual species had different trends at different sites.
When considering species trends overall, species with identical trends across sites were classified as such.
Species with a significant trend at one or more sites, but no significant trend at other sites, were considered to have a "weak" trend overall ("weak gains" or "weak losses," depending on the direction of the relevant significant trend).
Species with significant gains at one or more sites and significant losses at others, were considered to have "conflicting" (or "opposite") trends, where the impact of abandonment is context dependent.

When reporting magnitudes of AOH changes, we rely on two primary measures for each species at each site: 1) the magnitude of AOH change measured as a percent of site area ($100*(AOH_{end} - AOH_{start})/sitearea$, Figs. \@ref(fig:aoh-change-percent-by-trend) and \@ref(fig:aoh-change-percent-by-site)) and 2) the relative AOH change measured as the ratio of final to initial AOH, natural log transformed ($ln(AOH_{end} / AOH_{start})$, Fig \@ref(fig:log-ratio-aoh-change-by-site)).
Both measures of change are calculated using the mean AOH value for the first and last five years of the time series, in order to smooth annual variation.
We also report distributions of the absolute change in AOH ($AOH_{end} - AOH_{start}$; Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-change-by-site)), the untransformed ratio change in AOH (Fig. \@ref(fig:ratio-aoh-change-by-site)), and the slope coefficients estimated from linear regressions (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-slope-percent-by-site)).

## Species traits and the effect of abandonment on AOH {.unnumbered}

We fit three linear models using species traits to predict 1) the AOH trend (binary, gain or loss), 2) the magnitude of AOH change (% of site area), and 3) the relative AOH change (natural log transformed).
We extracted trophic level and body mass variables from a recent database of species traits for mammals and birds [@Etard2020] and combined them with variables derived from individual IUCN assessments [@BirdLife2021; @IUCN2021], including habitat preferences (suitability of various IUCN Level 1 habitats), habitat breadth (counting the number of suitable IUCN Level 2 habitats, following Etard et al. @Etard2020), vertebrate class, threat status, global range size, and tropicality (measured as the absolute latitude of the centroid of a species range).
We extracted arable and urban land suitabilities from the artificial terrestrial habitat category, and did not include the suitability of marine habitats as predictors.
To account for differences in the overall magnitude of abandonment at each site, we also included the percentage of each site that was abandoned during the time series, derived from Crawford et al. @Crawford2022.
The binary trend response variable was fit with a logistic regression, using R’s core glm() function with the “binomial” family, and the AOH magnitude response variables with a standard linear regression.
Model diagnostics were conducted through visual assessment of residual vs. fitted value plots (Fig. \@ref(fig:traits-model-resid-v-fitted)) and Q-Q plots (Fig. \@ref(fig:traits-model-qq)).
See SI Section \@ref(si-traits) for additional details.

## Assigning land cover to habitat types {#si-habitat-assignment}

We developed a method for assigning pixels in our coarse land cover classes to finer habitat types to match the habitats used by the IUCN to describe species' habitat preferences.
This process was based on a 2015 map of IUCN habitat types at 100-m resolution produced by @Jung2020a based on a dynamic crosswalk between the Copernicus land cover maps and the IUCN habitat types.
We in turn developed a simple crosswalk between our coarse land cover types and the finer IUCN habitat types mapped by @Jung2020a, as shown in Table \@ref(tab:iucn-crosswalk-table). 
But because there was not perfect spatial overlap between our land cover maps and the 2015 habitat map, we developed a method for assigning our pixels of land cover to the nearest habitat type on the @Jung2020a map that matched the broad category according to our crosswalk.
We first extracted only those pixels with habitat types that fell into each of our four land cover classes, and used a focal filter to assign habitat types to empty pixels based on the most common (i.e., modal) habitat type within the surrounding nine-pixel neighborhood (using the function `terra::focal(fun = "modal")`).
This produced four maps of potential habitat types for each pixel corresponding to each coarse land cover type.
We then masked each of these potential habitat types maps by the corresponding land cover pixels in each year at each site, producing maps of the likely habitat type for each pixel of land cover, in each year.
We then combined these four back together again to produce a map of habitat types at each site in each year, which served as input for our calculation of area of habitat (AOH). 
See maps below.

### Allocating savanna and shrubland habitats to land cover classes {#si-savanna-shrubland-jac}

Allocating the finer scale IUCN habitat types to our coarse land cover classes was straightforward for forests, grasslands, non-vegetation habitat types, and arable land, but less so for savanna and shrubland habitats, which are intermediate between entirely open grasslands and closed forests.
We considered shrubland and savanna habitat types to be a subset of our woody vegetation (i.e., forest) and herbaceous vegetation (i.e., grassland) land cover classes, respectively.
Because these habitats occupy intermediate zone between land cover classes, we conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess similarity between land cover and reclassified habitat maps under the full range of possible categorizations (Fig. \@ref(fig:jung-crosswalk-jac).
We found similar levels of spatial overlap across all possible categorizations, so we categorized these habitats to match how they would be classified directly from satellite imagery.

According to @Jung2020a, sites with significant area classified as shrubland include: Belarus (14%), Bosnia & Herzegovina (7%), Wisconsin (9%), Iraq, Nebraska, and Shaanxi (1-2%), and Chongqing, Volgograd, and Orenburg (~0.5%).
Sites with significant area in savanna include: Goias (69%), Chongqing (19%), and Mato Grosso (10%).

Our default approach was to classify savanna and shrubland habitats as grassland and forest land cover respectively, but we explored the consequences of alternative classifications by testing spatial similarity between the resulting reclassified maps. 
We calculated Jaccard similarity between our @Yin2020 land cover maps (for the year 2015) and the @Jung2020a habitat maps (for the year 2015) when reclassifying savanna and shrubland habitats as either forest or grassland.
The Jaccard similarity index is a measure of spatial similarity (i.e., overlap) between two sets, defined as the proportion of shared elements, or the intersection divided by the union (Equation \@ref(eq:jaccard-equation)) [@Legendre2012]:

\begin{equation}
J(a,b) = \frac{a\cap b}{a\cup b} (\#eq:jaccard-equation)
\end{equation}

We tested the full range of reclassifications, and the Jaccard similarity between the reclassified maps are shown in Fig. \@ref(fig:jung-crosswalk-jac).
Based on these results, we classified savanna as grassland. 
For shrubland, there was variation in similarity between land cover maps under these different reclassification rules, but no clear trend.
As a result, we conservatively consider shrubland habitats to be a subset of forest land cover, given that shrublands are most spectrally similar to forests from a remote sensing perspective.

<!-- We found that: -->

<!-- 1. At the three sites with significant amounts of shrublands (Belarus, Bosnia & Herzegovina, and Wisconsin) - which are all in forested biomes - the similarity between grassland maps increases when shrublands are considered grasslands (as do forest maps). The gold and black bars look basically the same for these three sites, which means that the increase is due to the shrub -> grassland crosswalk; the crosswalk for savanna does not seem to matter, likely because there is very little savanna at these sites. This pattern also holds for Iraq, which had about 2% shrubland (compared to 49% desert, 42% cropland, 4% grassland, and 2% urban). -->

<!-- 2. Sites with significant area in savanna (Goias, Mato Grosso, and Chongqing, though I know this isn’t really “savanna”) show greater similarity when savanna is classed as grassland, not as forest (this makes sense, given that these sites likely have a greater distinction between true forest and savanna). The green and gold bars are the same, signifying that the shrubland decision doesn’t matter much (because there is so little shrubland there). -->

<!-- 3. The four remaining sites - Nebraska, Orenburg, Shaanxi, and Volgograd - are all in grassland/steppe biomes, where the majority of the site is classified as grassland. At these places, the similarity is higher when shrubland is classified as forest (shown by the green and gray bars being higher). These increases are pretty small, however, and there is relatively little shrubland at any of these sites (max. 1.4% at Nebraska) -->

## Results of statistical tests comparing proportion of winners and losers by species group {#si-prop-test-results}

Throughout this analysis, we used two-sample Z-tests to test whether for equality between proportions of winner species (or loser species) for groups of interest, and applied Yates' continuity correction.
Mammals and birds showed statistically significant differences in the proportion of both winner and loser species following abandonment.
Mammals showed a significantly higher proportion of species that were winners (reported in main text), and also a significantly lower proportion of species that were losers [$X^2$ (df = `r p_test_loss_m_v_b$parameter`, *N* = `r sum(aoh_gain_bird_v_mam_tmp$N)`) = `r round(p_test_loss_m_v_b$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_loss_m_v_b$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_loss_m_v_b$p.value, digits = 2)))`].

When comparing the proportion of winner species between threatened and non-threatened species (including both mammals and birds), we found that the difference between these two proportions was not statistically significant [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_iucn_all$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_by_iucn_tmp %>% filter(aoh_type == "crop_abn_iucn") %>% .$N %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_iucn_all$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_iucn_all$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_iucn_all$p.value, digits = 2)))`].
This pattern held for Calculation 2 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_iucn_all_calc2$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_by_iucn_tmp %>% filter(aoh_type == "max_abn_iucn") %>% .$N %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_iucn_all_calc2$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_iucn_all_calc2$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_iucn_all_calc2$p.value, digits = 2)))`] and Calculation 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_iucn_all_calc3$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_by_iucn_tmp %>% filter(aoh_type == "full_abn_iucn") %>% .$N %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_iucn_all_calc3$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_iucn_all_calc3$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_iucn_all_calc3$p.value, digits = 2)))`].


This was also the case for birds [$X^2$ (df = `r p_test_iucn_bird$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_by_iucn_tmp %>% filter(vert_class == "bird") %>% .$N %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_iucn_bird$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_iucn_bird$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_iucn_bird$p.value, digits = 2)))`] and mammals [$X^2$ (df = `r p_test_iucn_mam$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_by_iucn_tmp %>% filter(vert_class == "mam") %>% .$N %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_iucn_mam$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_iucn_mam$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_iucn_mam$p.value, digits = 2)))`] individually.
When looking at individual IUCN statuses, we found a similar weak pattern, given that the number of species in each category was relatively low (Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-by-iucn)).

To understand the effect of recultivation on species' responses to abandonment, we compared the proportion of species with increasing trends in AOH to the potential proportion in a scenario in which no recultivation took place.
The proportions of winners showed statistically significant increases when recultivation did not take place, for both birds [$X^2$ (df = `r obs_v_pot_stats$bird_gain_p_test$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_overall_obs_v_pot_tmp %>% filter(vert_class == "bird", overall_trend == "gain") %>% .$N %>% sum()`) = `r round(obs_v_pot_stats$bird_gain_p_test$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(obs_v_pot_stats$bird_gain_p_test$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(obs_v_pot_stats$bird_gain_p_test$p.value, digits = 2)))`] and mammals [$X^2$ (df = `r obs_v_pot_stats$mam_gain_p_test$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_overall_obs_v_pot_tmp %>% filter(vert_class == "mam", overall_trend == "gain") %>% .$N %>% sum()`) = `r round(obs_v_pot_stats$mam_gain_p_test$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(obs_v_pot_stats$mam_gain_p_test$p.value < 0.01, "< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(obs_v_pot_stats$mam_gain_p_test$p.value, digits = 2)))`]


We also compared proportions of winners and losers across three calculations of AOH with progressively wider temporal and spatial scope (see Fig. \@ref(fig:aoh-sample-trajectories)).
For birds, the difference between proportion of consistent winners was statistically significant between Calculation 1 and 2 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_gain_bird_by_calc12$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_bird_by_calc_tmp$N[1:2] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc12$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc12$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc12$p.value, digits = 2)))`], Calculation 1 and 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_gain_bird_by_calc13$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_bird_by_calc_tmp$N[c(1,3)] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc13$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc13$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc13$p.value, digits = 2)))`], and Calculation 2 and 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_gain_bird_by_calc23$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_bird_by_calc_tmp$N[2:3] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc23$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc23$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_gain_bird_by_calc23$p.value, digits = 2)))`].
For mammals, the difference between the proportion of consistent winners was statistically significant for Calculation 1 and 2 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_gain_mam_by_calc12$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_mam_by_calc_tmp$N[1:2] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc12$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc12$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc12$p.value, digits = 2)))`] and Calculation 1 and 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_gain_mam_by_calc13$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_mam_by_calc_tmp$N[c(1,3)] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc13$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc13$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc13$p.value, digits = 2)))`], but not for Calculation 2 and 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_gain_mam_by_calc23$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_gain_mam_by_calc_tmp$N[2:3] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc23$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc23$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_gain_mam_by_calc23$p.value, digits = 2)))`].

The proportions of consistent losers also showed significant differences for birds between Calculation 1 and 2 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_loss_bird_by_calc12$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_loss_bird_by_calc_tmp$N[1:2] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc12$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc12$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc12$p.value, digits = 2)))`] and Calculation 1 and 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_loss_bird_by_calc13$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_loss_bird_by_calc_tmp$N[c(1,3)] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc13$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc13$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc13$p.value, digits = 2)))`], but not for Calculation 2 and 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_loss_bird_by_calc23$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_loss_bird_by_calc_tmp$N[2:3] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc23$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc23$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_loss_bird_by_calc23$p.value, digits = 2)))`].
We found the same pattern for mammals, where the difference between proportion of consistent winners was statistically significant for all pairs of calculations: Calculation 1 and 2 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_loss_mam_by_calc12$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_loss_mam_by_calc_tmp$N[1:2] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc12$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc12$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc12$p.value, digits = 2)))`] and Calculation 1 and 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_loss_mam_by_calc13$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_loss_mam_by_calc_tmp$N[c(1,3)] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc13$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc13$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc13$p.value, digits = 2)))`], but not for Calculation 2 and 3 [two-sample proportion test: $X^2$ (df = `r p_test_loss_mam_by_calc23$parameter`, *N* = `r aoh_loss_mam_by_calc_tmp$N[2:3] %>% sum()`) = `r round(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc23$statistic, digits = 2)`, *p* `r ifelse(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc23$p.value < 0.01,"< 0.01", paste0("= ", round(p_test_loss_mam_by_calc23$p.value, digits = 2)))`].

## Extra results

This effect was more intense for losers, who on average lost `r effect_size_stats_tmp$mean_aoh_lost_percent_obs`% of site area (reducing individual AOH by a factor of `r mean_effect_size_df %>% filter(str_detect(aoh_type, "pot"), stat == "mean_ratio", trend == "loss") %>% pull(value)`), compared to average winner gains of `r effect_size_stats_tmp$mean_aoh_gained_percent_obs`% of site area (increasing by an average factor of `r mean_effect_size_df %>% filter(str_detect(aoh_type, "pot"), stat == "mean_ratio", trend == "gain") %>% pull(value)`), when no recultivation took place.

## Trends in Mato Grosso, Brazil {#si-mato-grosso}

Limiting recultivation in Mato Grosso would have affected a large number of species given this site's high species richness.
Here, `r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_improve_n_total` additional species showed significant gains in habitat in our scenario of potential abandonment (Calculation 1P), transitioning from either no trend (`r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_improve_n_bird_no_trend` birds and `r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_improve_n_mam_no_trend` mammals) or from significant losses (`r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_improve_n_bird_loss` birds and `r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_improve_n_mam_loss` mammals) for observed abandonment (Calculation 1).
On average, each of these species gained `r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_improve_mean_p_gain`% more AOH by the end of the time series in the scenario of potential abandonment (Calculation 1P) than was actually observed (Calculation 1).
For comparison, only `r obs_v_pot_stats$n_sp_improve_non_mg_bird` bird and `r obs_v_pot_stats$n_sp_improve_non_mg_mam` mammal species across all sites outside of Mato Grosso changed to significant gains in our scenario of potential abandonment.
Meanwhile, `r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_worsen_n_bird` bird and `r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_worsen_n_mam` mammal species at Mato Grosso had their AOH trend worsen under our potential abandonment scenario (Calculation 1P), with AOH declining by `r obs_v_pot_stats$mg_worsen_mean_p_loss`% on average relative to observed abandonment (Calculation 1).


## Traits {#si-traits}

### Expanded methods



### Expanded results

To explore the ecological factors that may affect species responses to cropland abandonment, we fit three linear models using a variety species traits to predict 1) the AOH trend (binary, gain or loss), 2) the AOH change as a percent of site area, and 3) the ratio of AOH at the start and end of the time series (natural log transformed).
These three models respectively provide insights on the association of species traits on 1) the likelihood of species experiencing statistically significant gains in habitat following cropland abandonment, 2) the overall magnitude of those changes, and 3) the magnitude of those changes relative to pre-existing habitat.

Our model predicting binary AOH trend showed that forest, savanna, and grassland habitat suitabilities all increased the odds of a species experiencing habitat gains following abandonment, with grassland suitability being by far the most consequential (increasing the odds ratio by a factor of 7.52, compared to factors of 2.46 and 1.60 for forest and savanna suitability respectively; Table \@ref(tab:traits-mod-table-main)). 
In contrast, arable land suitability was far and away the most consequential predictor that a species would lose habitat following abandonment, being associated with a 99% decline in the odds of being a winner.
Wetlands suitability also reduced the likelihood of gaining habitat, with the odds of being a winner declining by 37%.
When including no trend species, more generalist species (i.e., with a greater number of level 2 suitable habitats) are more likely to be winners than non-winners and less likely to be losers than non-losers (Table \@ref(tab:traits-mod-table-binary)): for each additional IUCN Level 2 suitable habitat, the odds of being a winner over a non-winner increased by 6%.
This coefficient was not statistically significant in our primary model.
A range of factors were associated with a species being more likely not to have a statistically significant trend in any direction, including savanna and shrubland suitability, and greater distance from the equator.
Species in sites that experienced more abandonment were less likely to have no trend. 
In this model, rocky, caves, and desert habitats did not have significant associations, nor did vertebrate class, IUCN threat status, trophic level, body mass, or range area.

Binary model additional results:
When including no trend species, more generalist species (i.e., with a greater number of level 2 suitable habitats) are more likely to be winners than non-winners and less likely to be losers than non-losers (Table \@ref(tab:traits-mod-table-binary)): for each additional IUCN Level 2 suitable habitat, the odds of being a winner over a non-winner increased by 6%.
This coefficient was not statistically significant in our primary model.
A range of factors were associated with a species being more likely to not have a statistically significant trend in any direction, including savanna and shrubland suitability, and greater distance from the equator (Table \@ref(tab:traits-mod-table-binary)).
Species in sites that experienced more abandonment were less likely to have no trend. 

When considering the magnitude of AOH changes as a percent of site area, the associations of traits and response to abandonment shifted slightly.
Similar to the binary trend model, species with grassland and savanna suitability saw greater increases in AOH change, adding an additional 3.1% and 1.66% of site area as habitat following abandonment, whereas arable land suitability was associated with declines in AOH of 4.66% of site area.
Forest suitability did not have a significant association with AOH magnitude, nor did shrubland, wetlands, rocky, waves, desert, or urban suitability, nor vertebrate class, threat status, trophic level, or body mass. 
This is likely due to the fact that much less of abandoned cropland in our sites ended up in these types of habitats relative to grassland and savanna.
Species with a greater number of suitable habitats and larger ranges saw increases in AOH, of an additional 0.11% of site area for each additional suitable habitat, and 0.23% of site area for each increase in range size by a factor of e (~2.71). 
The more temperate a species’ range, the less their AOH increased, with the change in AOH declining by 0.02% of site area for each additional degree of latitude the center of their range moved away from the equator.
Species in sites that experienced relatively more abandonment also gained relatively more habitat. 
Each percentage point increase in abandonment as a share of each site was associated with an increase in AOH of 0.15% of site area.

Forest and grassland suitability resulted in relatively greater gains in AOH, leading to AOH change ratios that were 1.19 and 1.26 times greater than without these suitabilities, respectively (raising $e$ to the power of the coefficient value).
On the other hand, savanna and shrubland suitability resulted in smaller ratio changes in AOH, multiplying these ratios by factors of 0.75 and 0.92 respectively. 
The same thing was the case for rocky and urban habitat suitability, reducing ratios by 14 and 11% respectively. 
This is likely due to the fact that there was simply less savanna and shrubland habitat in abandoned croplands overall.
Like the other models, arable land suitability substantially reduced the change in AOH over time, resulting in ratios of ending AOH to starting AOH that were 77% smaller than expected. 
Patterns for range area, tropicality, and abandonment extent matched those in the model predicting the change in AOH as a percent of site area, with larger ratios for species with larger ranges, species in sites with more abandonment, and species with ranges closer to the equator.

Modeled trait associations are not markedly different when assuming no recultivation took place ("potential abandonment" scenarios).

Habitat breadth, or the number of habitats a species finds suitable for survival, was positively associated with increases in AOH following abandonment, likely because these species were less constrained by what types of habitats returned on abandoned croplands.

The lack of significance for forest habitat in the overall magnitude of AOH, and the reduction in AOH ratio for savanna and shrubland habitat suitability, may be simply due to the fact that much less of abandoned cropland in our sites ended up in these types of habitats relative to grassland and savanna (e.g., much less abandonment transitioned into forest at our sites; Crawford et al. 2022, Fig. S23).

Species in sites that experienced relatively more abandonment also gained relatively more habitat. 
Each percentage point increase in abandonment as a share of each site was associated with an increase in AOH of `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "percent", str_detect(term, "max_abn")) %>% pull(estimate)`% of site area and an increasing the relative gain in AOH by a factor of `r filter(trait_mod_coefs, response == "log_ratio", str_detect(term, "max_abn")) %>% pull(estimate)`.

### Additional model specification

Whether arable land is suitable habitat for a species is the strongest predictor of whether a species will gain or lose habitat following cropland abandonment.
When excluding arable land and urban land suitability as predictors in our models, a range of other predictors become statistically significant, including habitat breadth, vertebrate class, and trophic level (Table \@ref(tab:traits-mod3-table)).
For example, when excluding arable land suitability as a predictor in the binary models, savanna drops out, as does wetlands, and habitat breadth, vertebrate class, trophic level, range area, tropicality, and abandonment extent now start playing a role.
However, in this constrained model, the direction on the coefficients for habitat breadth change sign, such that more generalist species are now associated with losing AOH.
While it is possible that this represents a true relationship, meaning that more generalist species are more likely to lose habitat as a result of abandonment, it may be more likely that these newly significant coefficients rather reflect aspects of traits that are (poor) proxy indications for whether a species occurs in arable lands.

### Discussion

# Add paragraph explaining why we might expect predictor variables might work in specific ways (i.e., tropicality, body mass, range size, specialization, etc.).
# 
# Species with larger ranges were associated with greater relative and absolute gains in AOH, another straightforward 
# closer to the equator (tropicality)

(ref:caption-aoh-sample-trajectories) An illustration of the pixels included in each of our three AOH calculations. Land cover trajectories are shown for 10 hypothetical pixels (y-axis), with land cover for each year shown in colors (x-axis). The first six of these pixels are classified as having been "abandoned" for a least a portion of our time series based on our definition, and the last four are not, as indicated by labels at far right. Portions of each pixel's trajectory that are excluded from each calculation are denoted by dotted lines and lighter colors. Calculation 1 (left) includes only habitat provided by abandoned pixels, excluding land cover in those pixels prior to cultivation. Calculation 2 (middle) includes only abandoned pixels but includes habitat in each year (thus factoring in pre-abandonment habitat loss). Calculation 3 (right) includes all pixels for the full time series (thus factoring in habitat loss elsewhere at the site). See text for details.
